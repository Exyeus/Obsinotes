**Break and Continue Statements in Programming**
The `break` and `continue` statements are used to control the flow of a program's execution. They are commonly used in loops to skip certain parts of the code or to exit the loop prematurely.
### Break Statement
The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a switch statement. When a `break` statement is encountered, the loop or switch statement is terminated and the program continues executing the next statement after the loop or switch.
**Example:**
\```python
for i in range(5):
if i == 3:
break
print(i)
\```
Output:
\```
0
1
2
\```
In this example, the loop is terminated when `i` is equal to 3.
### Continue Statement
The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move on to the next iteration. When a `continue` statement is encountered, the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the next iteration begins.
**Example:**
\```python
for i in range(5):
if i == 3:
continue
print(i)
\```
Output:
\```
0
1
2
4
\```
In this example, the iteration where `i` is equal to 3 is skipped.
### Real-World Example
Suppose we have a list of numbers and we want to find the sum of all the numbers that are greater than 10. We can use a `for` loop and a `break` statement to achieve this.
\```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14]
total = 0
for num in numbers:
if num > 10:
total += num
break
print(total)
\```
Output:
\```
11
\```
In this example, the loop is terminated as soon as a number greater than 10 is found.
### Best Practices
* Use `break` statements sparingly, as they can make the code harder to understand.
* Use `continue` statements to skip unnecessary iterations, but make sure the code is still readable.
* Avoid using `break` and `continue` statements in complex loops, as they can make the code harder to debug.
### Common Use Cases
* Breaking out of a loop when a certain condition is met.
* Skipping unnecessary iterations in a loop.
* Exiting a switch statement when a certain condition is met.
### Code Snippets
Here are some code snippets that demonstrate the use of `break` and `continue` statements:
**Break Statement**
\```python
for i in range(5):
if i == 3:
break
print(i)
\```
**Continue Statement**
\```python
for i in range(5):
if i == 3:
continue
print(i)
\```
**Real-World Example**
\```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14]
total = 0
for num in numbers:
if num > 10:
total += num
break
print(total)
\```

**Break and Continue Statements: Key Differences**
The `break` and `continue` statements are used to control the flow of a program's execution, but they serve different purposes and have distinct effects on the program's behavior.
### Break Statement
* **Terminates the loop**: The `break` statement exits the loop entirely, and the program continues executing the next statement after the loop.
* **Exits the loop immediately**: When a `break` statement is encountered, the loop is terminated, regardless of the loop's condition.
* **Can be used with any type of loop**: `break` can be used with `for` loops, `while` loops, and `do-while` loops.
* **Can be used with switch statements**: `break` can be used to exit a switch statement when a certain condition is met.
### Continue Statement
* **Skips the rest of the loop**: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves on to the next iteration.
* **Does not terminate the loop**: When a `continue` statement is encountered, the loop continues executing, but the current iteration is skipped.
* **Can be used with any type of loop**: `continue` can be used with `for` loops, `while` loops, and `do-while` loops.
* **Does not affect switch statements**: `continue` is not applicable to switch statements.
### Key Differences
* **Termination vs. Skipping**: `break` terminates the loop entirely, while `continue` skips the rest of the loop and moves on to the next iteration.
* **Immediate exit vs. conditional exit**: `break` exits the loop immediately, while `continue` exits the current iteration based on a condition.
* **Loop termination vs. iteration skipping**: `break` terminates the loop, while `continue` skips the current iteration.
### Example Use Cases
* Use `break` when you want to exit a loop immediately, such as when a certain condition is met or when an error occurs.
* Use `continue` when you want to skip unnecessary iterations, such as when a certain condition is not met or when you want to optimize the loop.
### Code Snippets
Here are some code snippets that demonstrate the differences between `break` and `continue` statements:
**Break Statement**
\```python
for i in range(5):
if i == 3:
break
print(i)
\```
Output:
\```
0
1
2
\```
**Continue Statement**
\```python
for i in range(5):
if i == 3:
continue
print(i)
\```
Output:
\```
0
1
2
4
\```
**Real-World Example**
\```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14]
total = 0
for num in numbers:
if num > 10:
total += num
break
print(total)
\```
Output:
\```
11
\```
In this example, the loop is terminated when a number greater than 10 is found.
