牛逼程序设计语言的三个机制：
1. 具有原始简单的表达式与语句；
2. 具有能够将它们组合起来的办法；
3. 具有能够对它们进行抽象，将具体的大量代码抽象成为一个操作对应的名字的函数
In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: functions and data. (Soon we will discover that they are really not so distinct.)
对于操作的理解：将名字指示到了各种对象——name binds to the value
>这样操作的两种方式：
>\<name>=\<object>
>from \<module> import \<name>

### Expressions

One kind of primitive expression is a number.
Expressions representing numbers may be combined with mathematical operators to form a *compound expression*, which the interpreter *will evaluate*.

*Call Expression*.
The most important kind of compound expression. It applies a function to some arguments.

Function notation has three principal advantages over the mathematical convention of infix notation.
- First, functions may take an arbitrary number of arguments
- Second, function notation extends in a straightforward way to _nested_ expressions, where the elements are themselves compound expressions.
- Third, mathematical notation has a great variety of forms
### Environment

A critical aspect of a programming language is the *means it provides* for *using names* to *refer to* computational objects.If a value has been given a name, we say that the name _binds_ to the value.
程序需要一定的存储形式来记录这些名字，数值以及绑定关系。
这种存储形式被称为 `Environment`
The possibility of binding names to values and later *retrieving those values by name* means that the interpreter must maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the names, values, and bindings. This memory is called an _environment_.
即使是内置的名称<span style="background:#9254de">也可以被绑定到新的对象</span>:
```python
max(1,2,3);
>>>3
max = 6;
max;
>>>6
```

In Python, names are often called _variable names_ or _variables_ because they can be bound to different values in the course of executing a program.

When executing an assignment statement, Python evaluates the expression to the right of = *before changing* the binding to the name on the left. Therefore, one can refer to a name in right-side expression, even if it is the name to be bound by the assignment statement. For example:  `x = x + 1`
### 分析 Nested Expression 嵌套表达式?

步骤:
1. 分析所有的操作符与子表达式
2. 将函数作用于这些子表达式

这样的操作具有反复, 递归的性质, 在操作之中, 能够形成表达式树 `Expression Tree`
规定:
	数字符号, 值就是它为名的数字;
	名字值为, 在当前环境之中, 与这个名字绑定的值.

This illustration is called an _expression tree_. In computer science, trees conventionally grow from the top down. The objects at each point in a tree are called nodes; in this case, they are expressions paired with their values.
The interior nodes have two parts: the call expression to which our evaluation rule is applied, and the result of that expression.

Environments provide the context in which evaluation takes place, which plays an important role in our understanding of program execution.
Executing `x = 3` does not return a value nor evaluate a function on some arguments, since the purpose of assignment is instead to bind a name to a value. In general, statements are not evaluated but _executed_;
### Pure Function VS Non-Pure Function

**Pure functions.** Functions have some input (their arguments) and return some output (the result of applying them). The built-in function
`>>> abs(-2)`
can be depicted as a small machine that takes input and produces output. It has no effects beyond returning a value. Moreover, a pure function must always return the same value when called twice with the same arguments.

**Non-pure functions.** In addition to returning a value, applying a non-pure function can generate _side effects_, which make some change to the state of the interpreter or computer. A common side effect is to generate additional output beyond the return value, using the print function.
*Benefits*.
First, pure functions can be composed more reliably into compound call expressions.
Second, pure functions tend to be simpler to test.
Third, Chapter 4 will illustrate that pure functions are essential for writing _concurrent_ programs, in which multiple call expressions *may be* evaluated simultaneously.
