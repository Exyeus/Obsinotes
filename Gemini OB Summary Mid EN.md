Okay, absolutely! Based on the PPTs and our discussions covering Classes 1 through 7, here is a structured outline of the key concepts, models, and frameworks. I've tried to organize it logically to help you identify the right theoretical tools and use precise OB language for your group project.

This outline emphasizes the "building blocks" of OB understanding, moving from foundational concepts to individual processes and finally stress/well-being, which integrates many previous ideas.

**I. Foundational Concepts & Frameworks (Classes 1 & 2)**

*   **A. Defining Organizational Behavior (OB)**
    *   **Definition:** Study of individual, group, and structural impacts on behavior within organizations to improve effectiveness.
    *   **Goals of OB:** Explanation, Prediction, Influence/Control.

    *   **Management Skills:** Technical, Human (critical for OB), Conceptual.
*   **C. OB as a Science**
    *   **Systematic Study:** Emphasizes evidence-based approach over intuition.
    *   **Basic OB Model:** Inputs -> Processes -> Outcomes (at Individual, Group, Org Levels).
        *   **Independent Variables (IVs):** Presumed causes (e.g., personality, leadership style).
        *   **Dependent Variables (DVs):** Key outcomes OB seeks to explain/predict:
            *   *Performance/Productivity:* Effectiveness & Efficiency.
            *   *Attitudes:* Job Satisfaction, Organizational Commitment.
            *   *Behaviors:* Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB), Withdrawal (Absenteeism, Turnover), Counterproductive Work Behaviors (CWB - implied).
*   **D. Building & Evaluating OB Theory (Whetten, 1989)**

**How to Use This for Your Project:**

1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** Look at your case study. What is the central OB issue? Is it low performance (DV)? High turnover (DV)? Team conflict? Lack of innovation?
2.  **Determine the Level(s) of Analysis:** Is the problem primarily rooted in individual characteristics/processes, group dynamics, or organizational systems? Often, it's multi-level.
3.  **Select Relevant Theories/Concepts:** Use the outline to find theories that help *explain* the problem (the "Why").
    *   *Example:* If the problem is poor team decision-making, look under "Decision Making" (Biases, Bounded Rationality) and potentially "Group Level" concepts (if covered later, or infer from individual biases manifesting in groups). If it involves resistance to change, look at Perception (biases), Emotions (fear), potentially Personality (Openness), and Org Level (Culture, Structure).
4.  **Use Precise Language:** When describing the problem and its causes, use the specific OB terms from the outline (e.g., "role ambiguity" instead of "unclear tasks"; "escalation of commitment" instead of "unwilling to give up"; "low P-O Fit due to value incongruence" instead of "doesn't fit the company"). Cite relevant theories/models.
5.  **Propose Solutions Based on Theory:** Your solutions should directly address the identified theoretical causes.
    *   *Example:* If FAE is leading to unfair performance reviews, a solution might be implementing structured performance appraisals with behavioral anchors (reduces reliance on dispositional judgments). If low resources (JD-R model) are causing burnout, solutions involve increasing resources (autonomy, support, training). Justify *why* your solution should work using the theoretical logic.

This outline should serve as a strong foundation for applying OB concepts rigorously and professionally in your project. Good luck!
