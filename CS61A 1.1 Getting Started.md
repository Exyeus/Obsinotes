```Some basic ideas
1. representing information
2. specific logic to process those information represented
3. designing abstractions managing the complexity of that logic

To understand those above requires us to understand the way
computers interpret, and carry out those processes.
```

Statement: 用于执行操作，可以包含expression
Expression：用于数值的计算，它的本质，是一个数值
Assignment statement：将名称与数值（expression）捆绑：
```python
shakespeare = urlopen('https://composingprograms.com/shakespeare.txt')
```

Function：对操作数据的 逻辑 的封装
Object：对数据及其操作的逻辑的封装，解决两者的复杂性
Interpreter：处理代码，是Function与Object的Instance

be prepared for errors.

Learning to interpret errors and diagnose the cause of unexpected errors is called _debugging_. Some guiding principles of debugging are:

1. **Test incrementally**: Every well-written program is composed of small, modular components that can be tested individually. Try out everything you write as soon as possible to identify problems early and gain confidence in your components.
2. **Isolate errors**: An error in the output of a statement can typically be attributed to a particular modular component. When trying to diagnose a problem, trace the error to the smallest fragment of code you can before trying to correct it.
3. **Check your assumptions**: Interpreters do carry out your instructions to the letter — no more and no less. Their output is unexpected when the behavior of some code does not match what the programmer believes (or assumes) that behavior to be. Know your assumptions, then focus your debugging effort on verifying that your assumptions actually hold.
4. **Consult others**: You are not alone! If you don't understand an error message, ask a friend, instructor, or search engine. If you have isolated an error, but can't figure out how to correct it, ask someone else to take a look. A lot of valuable programming knowledge is shared in the process of group problem solving.
