Okay, carefully reviewing the slides for explicit and implicit **Organizational Behavior (OB) Frameworks**, here is a comprehensive list presented in the sequence of the classes:

**Class 1: 组织行为学基础模型**
1. **古典条件作用模型（Classical Conditioning Model）**
    - 通过刺激-反应（S-R）联结解释行为学习机制[1](https://openstax.org/books/organizational-behavior/pages/4-1-basic-models-of-learning)。
    - _应用场景_：员工培训中的习惯养成。
2. **科学管理理论（Taylorism）**
    - 泰勒提出，强调标准化和效率优化[4](https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/K12_Post%20Culture%20Climate_Positive%20Behavior%20Support%20Frameworks.pdf)[6](https://www.clickvieweducation.com/blog/classroom-management/theories)。
    - _应用场景_：生产线任务设计与绩效评估。
3. **霍桑效应（Hawthorne Effect）**
    - 员工因被关注而改变行为，凸显社会因素对生产力的影响[4](https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/K12_Post%20Culture%20Climate_Positive%20Behavior%20Support%20Frameworks.pdf)[6](https://www.clickvieweducation.com/blog/classroom-management/theories)。
4. **组织行为学的多层次模型**
    - 分三个层次：个体、群体、组织[7](https://www.jaroeducation.com/blog/types-of-organizational-behavior/)[8](https://resources.noodle.com/articles/top-8-organizational-behavior-theories/)。
    - _应用场景_：系统性分析员工行为与组织文化的关系。

**Class 2: Introduction & Models**

1.  **Basic OB Model:** An overarching framework illustrating inputs, processes, and outcomes at individual, group, and organizational levels (implicitly presented and central to the structure of OB).
2.  **Whetten's Framework for Theory Building:** A conceptual framework outlining the essential elements of a complete theory (What, How, Why, Who/Where/When).
3.  **Whetten's Framework for Contextualizing Theory:** Describes different approaches to incorporating and understanding context in OB research (e.g., "Looking through the lens," "Improving the lens," Theories in context, Theories of context).
4.  **Rousseau's Levels of Analysis Framework:** A fundamental framework for studying OB phenomena at the Individual, Group, and Organizational levels, including cross-level interactions and potential fallacies.
5.  **Historical Management Frameworks (as precursors/influences on OB):**
    *   Scientific Management Theory (Taylor)
    *   Administrative Management Theory (Fayol)
    *   Bureaucratic Management Theory (Weber)
    *   Human Relations Management Theory / Hawthorne Effect (Mayo)
    *   General Systems Theory (von Bertalanffy)
    *   X&Y Management Theory (McGregor)

**Class 3: Personality & Values**

6.  **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI):** A personality framework categorizing individuals into 16 types based on four preference dichotomies (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P).
7.  **The Big Five Personality Model (OCEAN/CANOE):** A dominant trait framework identifying five broad dimensions of personality (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism/Emotional Stability).
8.  **HEXACO Model:** Mentioned as an extension/alternative to the Big Five (adding Honesty-Humility).
9.  **Core Self-Evaluations (CSE) Framework:** A broad personality trait framework encompassing four specific evaluations: Self-Esteem, Self-Efficacy, Locus of Control, and Emotional Stability.
10. **The Dark Triad:** A framework grouping three socially aversive personality traits: Machiavellianism, Narcissism, and Psychopathy.
11. **Rokeach Value Survey Framework:** A framework distinguishing between Terminal Values (desirable end-states) and Instrumental Values (preferable modes of behavior).
12. **Generational Values Framework:** A conceptual approach grouping individuals into cohorts based on shared formative experiences, suggesting distinct value patterns (though cautioned against stereotyping).
13. **Person-Environment Fit Frameworks:**
    *   **Person-Job (P-J) Fit:** A framework assessing compatibility between individual characteristics and job requirements (Demands-Abilities, Needs-Supplies).
    *   **Person-Organization (P-O) Fit:** A framework assessing compatibility between individuals and the organization (Supplementary, Complementary, Value Congruence, etc.).

**Class 4: Perception**

14. **Factors Influencing Perception Framework:** A basic framework analyzing perception based on the characteristics of the Perceiver, the Target, and the Situation.
15. **Attribution Theory Framework (Heider, Kelley):** A theoretical framework explaining how individuals infer the causes of behavior (Internal vs. External attribution) based on Distinctiveness, Consensus, and Consistency.

**Class 5: Decision Making**

16. **Rational Decision-Making Model:** A normative framework outlining logical steps for optimal decision-making under specific assumptions.
17. **Bounded Rationality Framework (Simon):** A descriptive framework explaining how cognitive limitations, incomplete information, and time constraints restrict rationality, leading to concepts like satisficing.
18. **Intuitive Decision-Making Approach:** Presented as a distinct, often non-conscious decision-making process framework based on distilled experience.
19. **Rational Inattention Framework (Sims):** A framework explaining how decision-makers rationally allocate limited attention to costly information processing.

**Class 6: Emotions & Stress**

20. **Affective Circumplex Model:** A framework mapping emotions along two dimensions: Valence (Positive/Negative Affect) and Arousal (High/Low Activation).
21. **Affective Events Theory (AET):** A framework explaining how workplace events trigger emotional reactions that subsequently influence attitudes and behaviors.
22. **Emotional Intelligence (EI) Frameworks:**
    *   A conceptual framework based on the abilities to Perceive, Understand, and Regulate emotions.
    *   The Cascading Model of EI: A specific model showing the hierarchical relationship between EI components (Perception -> Understanding -> Regulation).
23. **Emotional Labor Framework:** A framework describing the process of managing and expressing organizationally desired emotions, including Felt vs. Displayed Emotions, Surface Acting vs. Deep Acting, and Emotional Dissonance.
24. **Stress Process Framework (Implicit):** While not explicitly named as a single model, the components discussed (Stressors, Individual Differences/Perception as moderators, Consequences, Management Techniques) constitute a general framework for understanding workplace stress.

This list focuses on the structured models, theories, typologies, and conceptual approaches presented in the slides that serve as frameworks for understanding OB phenomena.
