#review 

Part 1. Understanding current perspectives
	What to do with so-called 'culture'? There are cultural differences...But I think Internet has brought mergement in cultures, because...exaps...*This is the logic*.
Part 2. 
	Critique current perspectives. No true genius of 100% accuracy. Debug in those slides, if you find some mistakes. Notably, maybe not completely wrong, but *not quite suitable for current situations with lots of changes happened*. e.g. AI, changes in internship. A paradigm: classic rules turns incomplete with changes in a long time.
	Start with disagreement.
Part 3. Proposing Alternative Perspectives
	Build *improved frameworks*. No need to create a new framework.
	*An example*. In collectivism culture area, mainly Eastern Asia, people regard themselves and their families as a unit. So...emp: In US, it's common for parents to not pay children school fee, and for people not to feed their parents.

No talks in culture differences.

### Intro to Groups

More focus on interaction.
Switch: the properties has changed to another set.
Come toge'r to achieve certain goals.

> [!NOTE]
> loafing
> -- v．闲逛，游荡：无所事事地度过时间，不进行有意义的活动。

#### Type:

*Formal Groups*. Example: staff in a specific department.
*Informal Groups*. Students work together for exams.

#### Social Id'y Theo'y

Exp'in : why peo id'fy with particular groups;

> [!important] 
> Groups Id'ty sometimes should be avoid,
>  if ones out of the group exist

#### Social Idty in Action

#### Diff Social Idty

> [!important] 
> Some idties should be avoid, or selectively used, based on situations.
> For emps: researcher? parent? Chinese? Foreigners?

A person dev many idties throughout life.

#### Idties in Orgs

*2 Types*.
*Relational Identification*. Connecting through *roles*. ==More likely to leave this team, because no indentification towards the team. e.g. A friend quits and I quit, too==.
*Collective Identification*. Connecting with characteristics.
Strong Idef'n ->
	1. satis'fn
	2. increased OCB
	3. ...

#### Ingroups vs. Outgroups

categorize others as part of their group(ing') OR diff groups(out'g')

> [!seealso] 
> self-categorization theory

- Can lead to favoritism toward ingroup members
- May result in discrimination against out'g'

> Birds of a feather flock together

### Group Dev'mt Models

evolves from predictable patterns

#### Punctuated Equilibrium
1. First meeting sets groups' direction -- first *impression*. 
	framewk, assptn
	... For students' project teams, they usually, or should establish roles and timeline.

2. First phase of inertia
	follows initial direction
	reluctant to reexam' assptns

3. Transition at midp't
	Alarm clock effect
	heightened awareness of ddl
	group realizes need to accelerate

4. Major changes occur
	dropping and adopting

5. Second phase of inertia
	executing the revised

6. Final burst

#### Alt'ive Model: Forming Storming Norming Performing
![[Pasted image 20250515090354.png]]
*The Four Stages*.

1. start to form, polite, positive
2. conflicts come from their asserting ideas
3. start to dev cohesion
4. *Omitted.*
### Group Properties

special, and not exist without many persons.

#### Role. 
A funct assumed by smone in a given posi'n
	role percep'tn
		Influenced by: family cowkers media past exp'ence
	role expectatn

##### Norms and Conformity

> [!seealso] 
> Asch's Conformity Experiment
> Not much about your bottom line of morality, but the state of the group.
> Do not overestimate your strength in resisting the invading environment.

*How negative norms arise*

##### Typology of Unethical Wkplace Behavior

### Reference Groups

people most likely conform to their reference groups.
`people` here must be included in this reference group first!

#### Addressing Neg Norms

### Introduction to Status

Even the smallest groups dev *status* differences over time
Status is a signi motivator with major behavioral consequences
Status differences affect how group members interact and perform

>This greatly affect what we behave.
