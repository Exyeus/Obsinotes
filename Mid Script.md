Okay, Tim, let's refine your script specifically for that one-minute timeframe and focus on making it sound natural and connected for an oral presentation, keeping the assignment requirements in mind.

**Revised Script for Tim (Student A - Obstacles and Problems - 1 Minute)**

**(Assumed Intro: Group leader introduces the topic and members. Tim is introduced.)**

**Tim:** "Thanks, [Group Leader's Name]. Hi everyone. So, we're talking about more Americans studying abroad, which is exciting. But my focus is on the flip side – the **real challenges and obstacles** students often encounter.

**(Start Timer Here)**

"Probably the most immediate hurdle for many is the **financial** one. Let's be honest, funding tuition, international travel, and higher living costs abroad can be a significant barrier, making it tough, particularly for students without strong financial backing.

"But even if the funding is sorted, students then face the huge task of **cultural adaptation**. Imagine stepping into a place with completely different customs, social rules, maybe even a different pace of life. It can definitely lead to feeling overwhelmed or isolated, especially early on.

"And often tied directly to that cultural shift is the **language barrier**. If English isn't the local language, simple daily interactions become challenging, and understanding complex academic lectures? That’s another level of difficulty altogether.

"Speaking of academics, we also see significant **differences in university systems**. For instance, adjusting from frequent assignments, like we often have here, to a system where your entire grade might hang on one final exam requires a major mental shift.

"So, while the *idea* of studying abroad is fantastic, these practical, cultural, and academic hurdles are very real considerations for students."

**(End Timer Here - Aim for ~50-55 seconds to allow buffer)**

**(Transition)**

"It really shows the determination these students have. And that naturally leads us to ask *why* they push through these difficulties. **Ethan's going to explore the personal benefits that make overcoming these obstacles so worthwhile.** Over to you, Ethan."

**Why this revised script works better for your assignment:**
```

1.  **Conciseness for 1 Minute:** It hits the key obstacles (Financial, Cultural, Language, Academic) without getting bogged down in too many specific examples for *each*. It groups related ideas. (~150 words, easily deliverable in a minute at a natural pace).
2.  **Oral Style:** Uses conversational phrases ("Let's be honest," "Imagine," "That's another level," "speaking of academics"). It sounds more like talking than reading.
3.  **Connections & Flow (Addressing your specific request):**
    *   "But even if the funding is sorted..." (Connects Finance to Culture)
    *   "And often tied directly to that cultural shift..." (Connects Culture to Language)
    *   "Speaking of academics..." (Transitions smoothly to the next point)
    *   The concluding sentence wraps up the *idea* of obstacles rather than just listing them.
4.  **Clear Structure:** Starts with the overall topic, covers key points logically, and ends with a clear transition.
5.  **Meets Assignment Criteria:**
    *   **Content:** Logical, meaningful points directly related to the subtopic.
    *   **English:** Uses appropriate academic vocabulary (hurdle, barrier, adaptation, significant, encounters) within a natural conversational flow.
    *   **Vocal Variety/Energy:** The structure allows for changes in tone (e.g., emphasizing "huge task," "another level of difficulty"). Practice delivering it with enthusiasm.
    *   **Communication Language:** Includes a clear handover phrase ("Over to you, Ethan").
```

```

**Tips for Your Delivery:**

*   **Practice Aloud:** Time yourself! Adjust slightly if needed by cutting or adding a minor phrase.
*   **Don't Memorize Rigidly:** Know your key points and connecting phrases, but allow for some natural variation. This helps you sound more sincere and less robotic.
*   **Eye Contact:** Look at your audience and occasionally at your group members, especially during the transition.
*   **Tone:** Sound engaged and like you genuinely understand these challenges.

**Regarding the PC Discussion Part:**

Keep your notes on the PC contributions handy (Information Access, Communication, Learning/Adaptation, School Contact, Online Services). When the discussion part starts after Eric's presentation:

*   **Listen Actively:** Hear what others say first.
*   **Build On Ideas:** Use phrases like, "Building on what [Ethan] said about personal benefits, PCs really help with the *obstacles* I mentioned..."
*   **Introduce Your Points:** "...For example, the communication aspect [Point 2] directly tackles that feeling of isolation I talked about." or "And thinking about academic differences, PCs allow students to research university styles beforehand or even take online language prep courses [Point 3 & 4]."
*   **Connect to Others:** "Eric mentioned the economic side – even simple things like booking flights or managing money online [Point 5] are easier with a PC, reducing some logistical stress."

This revised script and the delivery tips should help you present your section effectively within the time limit and contribute meaningfully to the discussion, meeting all the assignment requirements. Good luck!
