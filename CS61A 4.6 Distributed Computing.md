### 简介

Different computers are independent in the sense that they do *not directly share memory*. Instead, they communicate with each other using _messages_,

### Messages

computers adopt a message protocol that endows meaning to sequences of bytes.
*A Message Protocol*。是一系列解码与解释信息的规则。明确一条信息属于特定的一种格式。还可以使用特定的 bytes 序列来明确信息的不同部分。
得益于此，不同操作系统的计算机得以共同处理一组数据。

*TCP/IP Protocls*. 这里注意这两个缩写。
 [Internet Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) (IP), The [Transmission Control Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)(TCP).
 Packets transferred using *modern IP implementations* (IPv4 and IPv6) have a maximum size of 65,535 bytes.
 *TCP* is an abstraction defined in terms of the IP that provides reliable, ordered transmission of *arbitrarily large byte* streams.The protocol provides this guarantee by *correctly ordering packets* transferred by the IP, removing duplicates, and requesting *retransmission* of lost packets. This improved reliability comes at the expense of latency, the time required to send a message from one point to another.

*The Process*. 
Establishing a connection between two computers A and B proceeds in *three steps*:

1. A sends a request to a _port_ of B to establish a TCP connection, providing a _port number_ to which to send the response.
2. B sends a response to the port specified by A and waits for its response to be acknowledged.
3. A sends an acknowledgment response, verifying that data can be transferred in both directions.
> The *port number* is of the port of A, and B can send message to this port.

### Client/Server Architecture

The client/server architecture is a way to dispense a service *from* a *central source*.

*Roles in practical applications*. The web browser application on a Web user's computer has the role of the client when requesting a web page. When requesting the domain name on the Internet, it must communicate with at least *two different* servers, as follows:
-  *DNS*. It is requested for the IP address. It can be implemented using python directly.
```python
>>> from socket import gethostbyname
>>> gethostbyname('www.nytimes.com')
'170.149.172.130'
```

- The Web server located at that IP address.
The response in this case is an [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) document that contains headlines and article excerpts of the day's news, as well as *expressions that indicate* how the web browser client should lay out that contents on the user's screen.
```python
>>> from urllib.request import urlopen
>>> response = urlopen('http://www.nytimes.com').read()
>>> response[:15]
b'<!DOCTYPE html>'
```

*An HTTP Request*. 
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol implemented using TCP that *governs communication* for the World Wide Web (WWW)
HTTP 请求有几种类型。最常见的是 `get` 。
*response codes*. A fixed set of response codes is a common feature of a message protocol. Designers of protocols attempt to anticipate common messages that will be sent via the protocol and assign fixed codes to *reduce transmission size* and establish a common message semantics

The abstraction of the model demonstrates a high level of *Modularity*, meaning that no part in this communicative process, need to care about the other side. They just send what they should send.

*drawbacks*.
- the server is a single point of failure
- computing resources become scarce if there are too many clients.

The client/server model is appropriate *for service-oriented* situations
### P2P Systems
there are other computational goals for which a *more equal division* of labor is a better choice. All the computers send and receive data, and they all contribute some processing power and memory.

This system has the identifying characteristic: *Division of Labor Among All  Participants*.

This network is composed of other computers running the *Skype application*. Each computer knows the location of a few other computers in its neighborhood. A computer helps send a packet to its destination by passing it on a neighbor, which passes it on to some other neighbor, and so on, until the packet reaches its intended destination. Skype is *not a pure peer-to-peer* system. A scaffolding network of _supernodes_ is responsible for *logging-in and logging-out* users, maintaining information about the locations of their computers, and modifying the network structure when users enter and exit.
