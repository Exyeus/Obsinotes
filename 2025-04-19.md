Some significant but currently not rooted unentrenchedly transformations in viewpoints.

All feelings come from perception and interpretation. And all of this essentially come from personality. So all dissonance and biases and so on, comes in the essential properties of your mindset and others. 

Based on these facts, you are progressing, and others are changing, therefore many problems will finally be solved.

The anxiety over some legacy fear, hatre, has never be the thing truly afflicting you. All those afflicting you, are nothing more than a shadow, a ghost, which gains power from your resistance.

All results of the worst situations, are actually greatly magnified, and all those results that are hopeful and positive, are superisingly neglected when so-called anxiety comes.

So, analyse the worst case under reasonal proposition based on facts instead of subjective judgements to see its minor possibility to occur, and focus more on the methods helping you to overcome this all with positive strengthening.

Notice all those biasing factors reducing the correctness in your judging. Some detrimental mindset predisposition may fundamentally stifle your rationality in deciding and perceiving. This should be treated seriously.

Also, keep check those contradicts and verbose implementation to some tasks that are always unheeded. For example. You once take lectures using a laptop and a pen tablet. Such a combination should not be created by a person who seeks the digitalization for his lecture notes. Also, the selection to methods should always be targeted at the maximization of efficiency.

This strategy recently has been appiled in dropping certain courses. If this course can be done with generally much better result, then the less-efficient pattern should be undoubtedly aborted.

Within this process, a problem naturally comes, is being confined with some existing viewpoints. I have got known, that in this society highly requiring its member to make contributions in a manner designed and appiled by it, individuals holding different attributes, should certainly to some extent make a riddance to those unnecessary work and restrictions, therefore, to maximize their growing rate.

So, its plausible to seek the GPA being all over or equal to 3.7, instead of previous all being exactly 4.0. Not meaning rejecting, but not seeking 4.0 on strong purpose, out of those fundamentally right but meanwhile seemingly less pickable paths, like doing real projects helping you to deal with this fact: *what you can do matters more than your score*. Senior high schools have universities as the buff between them and society, which requires people to work and survive, while universities have none.
