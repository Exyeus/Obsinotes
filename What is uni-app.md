`uni-app` is a framework for developing all front-end applications using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), developers write a set of codes, which can be published to iOS, Android, Web ( Responsive), as well as various small programs (WeChat/Alipay/Baidu/Toutiao/Feishu/QQ/Kuishou/DingTalk/Taobao), Quick Apps and other platforms.

With many prestigious companies adopting this implementation, uni-app is quite trust-worthy.
It offers an universal paradigm in designing products.
There are problems
1. so many terminals
2. bad experience
3. no SDKs available for all

features.
- cross-platform, not compromising the good features in different terminals. 
- Nice experience, by offering the same api and parts as Wechat applet, containing `weex` functions. *What is `weex`*?
- universal tech stack, with syntax of VUE, and api of wechat api, and `mpvue` embedded
- open community
	- npm for packages
	- costomized parts of wechat applet and SDK
	- supporting mpvue
	- supporting original mixed encoding?
