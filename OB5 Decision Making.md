### Decision Making as Response to Problems
•Problem: A discrepancy between current state and desired state.
Problem recognition itself is a perceptual process
### Problem Perception

A Deprt sales dropped 2% in the quarter.
*Is this a problem?*
Yes, this is negative.
*No*.
- This is a seasonal turbulance.
- This is not relevant to me
- This perhaps has underlying development in other aspects which reduces input on this aspect.
Complx and strategic.

### Perception and Info processing

- A must
- specific steps:
	- Screen - deter whts relevant
	- Process
	- Interpret
- Our perception may influence.
- ?Perceptual <span style="background:#d3f8b6">differences</span> explain why people reach <span style="background:#d3f8b6">different conclusions</span> from the same data

*Perceptual Influences on Problem Recognition*.
Research suggests employees may be motivated to <font color="#ffff00">deny or ignore</font> organizational problems during economic downturns when alternative employment is scarce.
### Perceptual Differences in Organizations

Instead of the individual level, an organization introduces more parties, which perceives the same *situation* differently. Pairs that conform to this:
- Managers vs employees
- Finance vs marketing departments
- Headquaters vs field operations
### Factors affecting decision perceptions

*Individual Diff*
- Personal traits
- Gender identity
- Intellectual abilities
- Cultural Background
> For example: Personal options? Contest for excellence or just pursue a pass.

*Organ-al constraints*.

- Formal Regulations. Terms on against TRUSTs

### Perception and Decision Framing

*Search for more info abt Framing*.

### Perception and Attribution in Decisions

*attribution*. 
How we explain causes of events and behaviors. This is the intermission of perception and decision making.

### Improving Perceptual Accuracy

*Some missing subtitles*.

### Approaches to Decision Making

*微观经济学*。
*The Rational Decision Making Model*.
- Def. how should maximize the outcome?
==concrete steps in deciding according to this==

*Assumptions of the Rational Model*.
There are a few assumptions on the decision maker.

*Decision set*. assess all alternatives?
- faces no time or cost constraints

? When is it acceptable to make these assumptions.

*A lot of content missing here*

### Not rational, then what?

*Bounded Rationality*.
The word 'bounded' does not mean small. It is like the D in *Multivarible Caculus*. It can be 'dense' and therefore abundant, but it is limited, and what outside the scope cannot be ideal.
Diff extent of being informed leads to diff decisions.

Formal Def.
Characteristics.

*Satisfying*.
Def. Seeking solutions that are merely sufficient ('good enough') rather than *optimal*.
差不多就行了. 什么是差不多?

*Rational Inattention in Decision Making*.
Def.
Keys.

Extra search gives no significant info comparing to previous info.
Therefore, ignore the following info, on purpose, is plausible.

*Intractable Problems*.
Def. 
Phenos.
	- Too Complex
	- Extensive ana -> analysis paralysis
	- If completed, situation may have changed

*Intuitive Decision Making*.
Unconscious, from distilled experience.
outside conscious thought
relys on <span style="background:#d3f8b6">holistic associations</span>
fast and emotionally charged
based on pattern recognition from experience
Not inherently irrational or wrong

*When Intuition works best*.
- crisis
- highly uncertain
- experienced decision makers *This is related to above: HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING*.
- complex, and depleted info
- patterns similar to previous cases.

### A Missing Subtitle

### Overconfidency Bias yes
Def. Overestimating our knowledge
### Anchoring Bias yes

Def. A tendency to *Fixate* on initial info, from which one then fails to adjust adequately for subsequent info.
### Confirmation Bias yes
Def. The tendency to seek out info th <span style="background:#d3f8b6">reaffirms</span> past choices and to <span style="background:#d3f8b6">discount</span> info that contradictspast judgements
### Availablity Bias

Def 
### Escalation of Commitment
>This can be counted as a bias

### A Few Missing Subtitles

### Risk Aversion

### HindSight Bias
Def. The tendency to believe falsely, after an outcome is known that one would have accurately predicted that outcome.
In other word, when you analyse previous events, you wrongly judge the key factors.
### Outcome Bias

Def. The tendency to judge 

### Ways to reduce bias

### Decisions ... Missing
