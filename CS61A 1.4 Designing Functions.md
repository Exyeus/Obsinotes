### 一些根本原则

- 每个函数都要有明确的功能。That job should be identifiable with a short name and characterizable in a single line of text. Functions that perform multiple jobs in sequence should be divided into multiple functions.
- 核心在于, 不要让自己陷入重复的机械步骤
- 定义具有泛用性的函数。Squaring is not in the Python Library precisely because it is a special case of the pow function, which raises numbers to *arbitrary* powers.

### 函数的使用介绍
A function definition will often include documentation describing the function, called a _docstring_, which must be *indented along with* the function body.
```python
def pressure(v, t, n):
	'''Compute the pressure in pascals of an ideal gas
	Applies the ideal gas law
	v -- volume of gas...
	t -- absolute temperature in degrees kelvin
	n -- particles of gas
	'''
	k = 1.38e-23 # Boltzman's constant
	return n*k*t / v
```

When you call `help` with the name of a function as an argument, you see its docstring (type q to quit Python help).
继续改进:
1. 使用默认值, 来使得函数调用更加方便
2. 将一些必须要用的东西, 例如这里的 Boltzman constant, 设为一个宏或者全局变量
