没有吗？没关系没有没有没关系好不好然后。
Group Friday，right？it's gonna not only need to identify problems because I think a ways to address them right？so this kind of a preview they have get you thinking about，you know what is a problem and what level might be happening at and you know，are there any kind of perspective solutions，you know I'm asking this homework to come up with a solution but it's something to think about，especially in the future when you become manager，you guys employee，right？if you need to go with solutions to organizational problems。
To recall last class，we spoke about levels of analysis，right？we have the organization level，which is the whole company of the whole school or the whole firm right？and then we have group，which is the middle level，right？we have a teamwork and then we have the individual level we're probably the easiest to understand it's you so single person so starting from today we're going to go a deep dive into sub topics right？so the three levels of analysis and。
在今天最重要的which I think is probably the easiest to understand because we've all been individuals right。
就可能不要这么轻微跟还没进入组织对吧？没有麦克斯就没有大公司那个这些毕竟都当过个人right所以说of it ourselves we'll start an individual level，然后可能是没有做过什么，那个没有可能是动力，还有很没有什么job design，但是毕竟是每个人都自己性格对吧？这也没有什么理解，不过还不personality right就算是easiest level with the easiest topic it was going to work our way up to more complicated。
Perhaps more difficult to understand ideas -------- today，if you preview the material right？the topic was personality，so hopefully you got some time to do some reading and events either from the textbook or from other sources or if you haven't I know personalities are very familiar topic right，we talked about your MBTI，are you ENTJENFP something something right？I think you've all probably heard personality and if not，you can learn about today so personality。
As I said，you know what levels are happening at individual level，right？we don't have a group personality per SE it's usually people have personalities。
So what do we try to learn？say，what is the kind of key topics recovery you know what is personality and why is it important for organizations particularly work also we're trying to explain you know what different frameworks？we have to think about personality and it will have the ETI right so is that it is just your ENTJ or INTP and that's just who you are are the other ways to think about frameworks to be honest with you I personally don't like to use MBTII think there are better approaches out there so。
We'll also talk about how to measure personality and what do organizations do with those school results Maybe right now -------- students I don't think they select students based on personality right？
Jacob晚上来，是吗？
Go to a company。some places do screen a personality。
我们的护照什么什么新的对吧？------------ ---------------- will do a holistic assessment so initially。
Also，we talk about personality we'll start our values就是价值观那个是不是同一东西啊，就是你有性格你是不是可以价值观一样，那怎么不一样呢？so we'll talk about that later，right？and then also personality as I mentioned before right we'll talk about things organization is complicated near the machine though，right？
Now you can think about you know，what team are you in，what Java are you with？so it's not just about personality it's often about the fit就是没有什么觉得这个是个好性格就是暴力sensor那当然of course。有一些因素可能不太好看我自己我不要紧张对不对就叫neuralism但不是很好对吧，但是一般来说就是性格方面没有什么觉得好还是不好，那是一个匹配的问题，你这样性格是不是这样的工作老师说你是个外向的人，那你就。
应该当一个编程师Maybe not right，so it's about fitting the right person to the right job she's got a big topic so I cover today。
Any questions before I start no you're good，OK？
Zero one is ersonality，right，we're talking about ersonality，we said，oh，you're extra bird or，you know，thinker，right，what is the personality？so the kind of official definition right is说实话就是if you look at the actual definition of it's hard to understand but you intuitively就是那个facial personalities，but it is basically it's the combination of how you interact，the psychological systems that determine how you interact the environment。
Maybe it's a special definition but it's hard to understand。I think the good deal of personality is you all have experience with it。sorry don't you go explain to you before the more complicated concepts like team level or organization level，the actual definition is very important，but basically，I think important thing about personality to know it's different than your role like这些角色不是一个价值观。
就应该是你出生的就比较stable right，你这是你本身是比较定性的you are this type of person now，of course as you talk about personality change over time。your research shows that people get older，they have to become less extravagant就是年轻人，都是比较爱社交对吧？年纪大了就会累了。but generally speaking personally stable，你很难说我本身就是不害羞，如果本身害羞，我说你不害羞就it's hard to intention to change your personality。
Also it will influence，your behavior across many different situations就是说这个影响应该是必须要一致就是宣武门上fit对吧？我问说是哦你这个情况是这个personal nature是另外一个personnel那当然你可以做一些调整上那个person management对吧都是控制那个控制情绪啊这些东西不，实际上你本身的人就是定的。
And then this will you can see a person of your behavior your thoughts your emotions but it's not just about outside就不仅是表面的also it's internal processes，you know，how do you feel？
所以刚才说了一大堆啊，但是应该是大家都还是比较理解，是比较性格。
So why do we say personality，right？I mean，of course，it's good to know ourselves，I think probably就举手。如果你错过性格就是自己玩过错过性格，性格追求错过吗？就是因为大王你吃过对吧？我是什么人，right？
But for an organization it's very important。you know，if you're going to人才培养，那应该发展在哪个方向？那你是不是看这个外向的性格应该是作为老板主动就是给你一些机会，多当一些什么那个客户就是对，就是面对客户的一些工作。so，this is all very important not to be higher。but also how do we train？how do we develop leaders right？
You know，other sort of personality traits that we might want to look for or think about leadership development also so it says employee selection our job design also for choosing，a team right？who should we choose to our team members，this is an important question for you too。Maybe we all know about our own personality，but when we do individual level assessment it's not just assessing ourselves it's not seeing other people so later right at the end of the class we'll talk about teams because we have team project。
So how do you choose your team members，should you consider personality right？if you're a quiet person，should you choose other quiet people？is a team of，you know，five quiet people good or you need somebody to get the presentation something to consider right？that's a good personality composition，but of course，that's going to the team level，right？
但是那个本身的那个底层的那个因素是那个individual personality。
这样说吗？现在我们可以知道吗？就是a lot of times we talk about higher level things right，like team structure，right？we talked about，you know，how do we do？organizational level things a lot of times it's grounded in individual level so why do you something individual level is because it is the Foundation of higher level就是说白了你没有个人你怎么可能团队？so，如果你不了解个人，那实际上这些团队是因为空的right this is kind of critique of macro level research你不考虑那个个人的你怎么说公司跟。
之间的关系，比如说我以前我也是我眼中，我说公司之间他们有些互动啊，他们就是竞争，那他是一个人怎么样他不管，他就是公司跟公司之间的事儿，但实际上没选那些没有公司，那当然你说这个cross level，我们上次聊过那个不好做对吧？but他们基础都是个人的，然后就慢慢慢慢的往上爬。
你好OK？
So how to measure personality now one way it's very common is that you know personality test，right？you answer some questions also to the individual right？individual assessment，right，you assess yourself。
Another way to is also you can have other people assess you if you're managing it right就是你老板可以给你拼。我觉得这个人怎么样那个supervisor就是not you waiting yourselves就是self rate right I do my own I think I am a nice person。so these are the questions it's not good to reach yourself，you know，are you a hard worker？of course，are you smart，of course。
Often this is better predictor right because we're very biased in our individual social desirability right？I want to be a manager。我上面老师，我上面领导。so，我是不是外向的性格，of course，I love people，I love to tell I'm a nice guy，right？but if you say，you know，does my中国导师认为我这个适合evaluation right？so that's why a lot of times to do an accurate ratings？
Don't ask individually to ask other people oftentimes their manager？or Sometimes we ask some of their peers right？they're going to evaluate the performance你们几个团队员那些龙头怎么样对吧？但是more standard ratio。
This is not what it is，so a very important question，what is personality come from？
那有两个两个比较派one side says，你天生都是这样的人，你出生就是这样的人，你看你这个害羞就是出生的害羞的对吧？another one says，不是你小时候你看老师那个就是感觉，感觉这个大哥都在打听事情，自己都不好说话对吧？你觉得你作为最小的那个小朋友对吧？肯定是个人管的多啊。so what do you think do you think personalized for nature facing your genes？
Is what you have when you're born or is it nurture based on you know how you're raising the child is important we're talking about is important events that shaped your work。what do you think the personalized nature or nurture did you're not？
First of all。
Is true。that is true both。yeah，what you think is more important，is it？relatively speaking。
Our nature also have more nurture people here you remember nurturing要说一说吗？anybody want to say nurture team？
Nature，why nature？and so I believe that so personality that social concept，it means the way we interact with others and interact with ourselves。and so through her with others who must behave in society that is the process of nutrient is of our first contact to the society and how we are neutral，I believe influences。
How influences our concept of the society and then influences，our personality and so without the interactive society we do not。we will not have personality I believe that's an interesting point I'm not going to talk about too much today，but we do know that different cultures and different personality tendencies and that's like Maybe not I'm not sure like how widely accept that it is or how like strongly the admin support is，------------ -------------------- is some perspective to talk about，you know，like Asian cultures Maybe they have certain person。
Entities，right，so it's a good argument for nature for nature？what are the nature sign？I saw some nature people，no，no，no，no，no nature argument nature guy。
OK，要不你先把OK II judges by my own example，because my mom always said I am I was quiet，and I am a quiet，baby，who would like to Fall obey the rules，but my my，my brother，my little brother was a was a baby who who like to bring some something，and I think。
For now，it always like it used to be。就是说我弟弟和我之前性格就是很大程度上决定了。可以看出来现在的性格是什么样子，就是take my myself example，so。
Yes，we can take identical Twins as defense and identical Twins can have totally different personalities is not there，so I think nature matters。so I think you're always a very interesting point，right？so I read a jump point，right？so two people in the same environment，right？so Maybe you say pants is a different是第一个孩子。第二个孩子可能养不一样对吧？这是第一个感觉比较尖掉一点比较松，在这不不管怎么样喂over the family。
Identical Twins从基因角度看，应该是一模一样的right。所以如果是基因一模一样的，那怎么可能是一个不一样。
Right，because if they're born the same way，right？
And it both matter，but，you know，early on，right？they focus more on biological，right？it was more about。
You know，nature，right，and then later on we've shown this to the twin studies bus adoption就是领养的也是。比如说if we take two different families a little different also。如果我发现这是工作文化，也是一个稳定的那个性格的那个if across culture if you have stable personalities那是不是说明是一个文化的层面对吧？像我们刚才我们聊的地方，如果是中国人怎么怎么样，那是中国的噱头吗？还是个中国文化？
像it's complicated，right and kind of understanding is the matter，but Maybe genetically it affects your range就是你的可能性就是天生可能是就是那样的人对吧？可能是你不管怎么样都比较害羞的，不过你可以没那么害羞，你可以非常害羞，然后如果你看本身就像我话多，我可能学会就是学控制自己啊，那个人被洋气那是安静的人，那不会说那个透露出来什么的。so Maybe。
The genetics will set the possible range，but specifically where you kind of Fall within that is also largely affected by your environment that you raised it so it's complicated，right？
那这个明白吗？就是一个是那个那个那个空间对吧？那个距离到哪儿？可能是也是这个意思吧，但是也是更重要的。it's hard to say right，because也是一个很very broad range right也没有找这个variance到底多大，我这个我也不知道，我不知道那个genetically how much range can you have？
哦，而且你拍就拍没关系，但是后面都会发群里啊，所以就来写，那可以拍不不不不，不是第一次，就是说我们家并没有这么幸福，因为我知道有一些人现在哦，now should be stable right应该是稳定了对吧，只不过有新的来，所以就是我就跟大家说一说，第一，如果你不在微信群，你就跟你那个同同桌的时候要一下那个微信群，然后第二我会把所有的那个课件都发在群里啊。
包括有一些同事分享你一些以前那些课本，如果你当时就要进去，你可以问一下，我就我就不管这件事儿对吧？但是这个在群里发过一些东西，然后会跟我联系的话，你可以加我微信，或者可以发邮件我的Office hours在第一课就讲了，就是schedule就是跟我提前联系好对吧？你有什么问题就是越早越好，就是别别等到平时作业你不能等到今天是唉。
我那个有些问题，这个就a little bit too late contact earlier，然后包括这次有几个同学就是联系我了。问这些问题就是看是发表作业第二天第三天非常好啊，就是早点联系就过了，什么问题啊，我也不介意，你看我肯定也挺快啊，这不用不用不用什么害羞的啊。OK，any other questions。
OK，just。just go to the Wechat build if you're not in there，OK？OK，那sorry。think about right，你承认你自己啊。so to our personality，right，he said ENTGNFP whatever，right？------------ -------------------- are different levels。你觉得你自己比较dominant比较突出的是什么方面的？你可以想一想就是which can be dominant。然后你先想一想so what's kind of your dormitory。
然后你是不是一直这样的还是不是长寿？不像现在就这个样子，你说你这个比较高人，那个性格是不是有变化的？所以这个stable time and then what do you think it's causing this change for future是不是有些情况就是，所以context一直就会比较容易出现出来就是一些data context呢是一个控制一下其实一个性格and also you know，do you think it affects your teamwork就是我们比如说作业对吧？
比如说我这边就是话多，这些比较紧张的，所以就变成什么I try to get the work done very quickly and I like to communicate a lot。you know，did you do your part yet？no OK，when are we going to be done？did you finish your part？okay，don't worry no，okay，yeah，I know that my personality kind of shows how my team work，how are you，do you think it helps you do you think it makes it harder，to do the working groups，you think it，you know，is a beneficial academic work。
有啥分享吗？
Sometimes I know personality is hard to talk about because是比较怎么说如果我们讲了少数作业，我可以想，哎呀啊，你发现不认识他们，但是那地方人知道不跟你说真的什么什么什么对吧？那时候自己呀，就不是那个不好意思讲自己就是可能是那it's very close to ourselves，but you can think about you know what can you do how do you control your personality how is expressed，can you use it to benefit in a situation？
So we have a partner person like，how do we go about actually measuring from our kind of organizational or business perspective right how to use personality as a company because，you know，talk about it for yourself，你认识自己就行了对吧？我在公司，那么他们用这个personality we do retiring and also we have different tests right we have self-read tests other people ------------ there's a major thing ethical concerns。
Now，if we use，for instance，if I ask you to boss，你觉得这个人性格怎么样？然后我用这个就是决定你心能不能进入我们这个培养这个情况。is that you know should we be allowed to use personality because as I said，personality is relatively stable比如说我就是就是比较外向的人，那这个如果你不外向的话就不拼你吗？你也改不了这个事情。
It's not like you try to，you know，try and harder，not setting，well，you know，if we were to discriminate against people or race就说mobile people颜色就不能拼，因为那个什么什么的原因，那时候猫猫星座的原因就不是P，这个公不公平啊。it is back to screening based on personality no。
It's hard to say。
The test can accurately reflect their personality and I think it may be feasible，but。
Actually，there is no test that can accurately reflect what's personality。so I think it's no way it is ethical at all because I think。
We should I believe that the the fundamental principle for organizations that we're employees is that they should just the employees or their interviewee based solely on their Contacts or are there suitable for their suitability for the job？
So。
I don't want people who are，you know，shy because it's a sales job，right？yeah，is that fair？yes，fair that little fair because organizations do use personality screening right？so don't feel bad saying anything is fair or not，right？if you think it's fair，you know if it's a sales job，right？yeah，we test to see，you know，are you，you know，agreeable，right，everybody。
Yes，yes，yes。so if I see if the interview is shot，I think he or she won't apply for a sales job。so this is a fundamental question，right is do you care about？
Who you are right at your personality rights的基础，right about your behavior what If I Say yes I'm a very shy person。I can sell very well when I need to，you know，make a sale，I get it done I don't care how I feel I will get that sailed up。
No，sorry，sorry，no，you saw too low on the shyness。sorry your score is not higher，is that fair？that's not fair。
But it's hard，I think because I said，well，I'm a costume，have you had any sales experience right？no，but I can sell trust me right？so it's challenging，you know if you care about the actual behavior results and we care about the antecedents。
这是一个，那你不能你不能要求说你就是本科生，你没准来我们班的，剩下把这个卖了对吧？please tell me this time right。
So it's challenging because you want to base on the actual actual behavior right？but often it's hard to measure that so there's no right answer，but it is kind of ethical Dilemma Sometimes。
So I assume you've all heard this first Test right this MBTI，right？there's also，have you heard of big five？do you know big five personalities？yeah，what do you think？do you like MBTI directly five无所谓吗？
Anybody in any opinions？
各位的啊。this is my personal thing，right，I personally prefer big five。because the dimensions are Maybe more stable and also they're easier to I don't think they're more useful and in regards to me。but I also see a lot of research tends to use big five there's our critiques of MBTF ------------ -------- be honest，I don't do personality research。
But just observing the literature I think people tend to prefer the big five for academic research but MBTI if we do it for my personality test right？就是网上自己测一次什么性格right？I think that is Maybe more fun。I feel like when I read the big five results it's like，okay，I have Highness dimension alone dimension because the scale which you can predict so，你这个就是一个什么人，那个什么人，这就是唉，因为这个says you scored high in this dimension you scored all this dimension。
And then it doesn't really give me a clear typology就是那个typology分类的so Maybe you have more than DTI？but how do research Maybe use the client？
So we talked about this you're using for many different places，you know？choosing people you know who you select to work with the company who select to get your promotion of her development right？
But you know，some real core critics of personality is one you know oftentimes预测能力啊。就the relationship the relationship between personality and actual behavior right？I ask you if you are a shy person if you're not a trigger interpreted should I say we're not going to hire you the reason why this is a concern is because oftentimes the predictive humidity can predict your ability to be a successful salesperson。
Maybe it's not very strong，because as I said，right，I can control my personal control myself。I can act more extra，more social，even though I may not say personality wise，he doesn't have a person。
Also covered，MBTR column with this is Maybe some very strongly supported by the science。if you look at the results of the testing，Maybe it's not very stable predictor。
Another issue too is responsive，you know，for instance，right we talked about，is it our previous personality test for a sales job？那假如说，如果你想一想，就是比如说我们这个这个同学说比较内向对吧？那今天要找工作，我们这儿是搞那个咨询公司，看市面上客户，你说你要成一个person，address，你要成怎么样？我跟别人在一起我就比较害羞，你会这么舔吗？那就肯定会写I love people，right。
People go over people，please are a happy guy，right？you want to write these things because you know what the job requires this isn't just a problem for personality test it's a problem for any self reported test because if the person doing the test knows what the outcome will be，effective。so for instance，right？I'm trying to look for leadership，right？if it's a test to see if you make a good leader，you try to answer in a way that you think will give you a better score even if it may not be an accurate reflection to go。
I often have other people great as opposed to ourselves。
Somewhere，right in high stake situation you can fake your responses even if they ask you to pretend right？就假如说我说那个测试一下对吧？假装当那个销售员you probably try to act much more extra very than you really are and then you even act in actual work，right？because this is very important to your exam，right？
Another issue is stereotyping，so it goes as the question was mentioned right is can we use this it's a discriminatory，right？and you say oh。
Actually，people are better at selling Internet people should not be salespersons。is that fair？you know，Maybe extroverted people are too intense就是说太太压力太大对吧？你不买呀，不买就别走了。
You don't want that so Maybe it's good to help introverted people make a few more relaxed low pressure so it's hard to say that the dealer就是做这种事情。I know you did the mbti test right it says很多人说你适合什么岗位对吧？因为吃过对吧？你这个人适合做那当然我不知道你们当时怎么做，但我这也可能彻底刺发现在赶快比较合适right就是回到那个desirability bias就是我当时除了性格可能是我最后希望得到那个找工作对吧，比如说你适不适。
不好，这是C的咨询公司，是不是适合当老板？哎，乐商学院如果要说你适合，比如说做一个这种artist，right is that what you wanted，Maybe in the wrong school，right？so you might Keep trying to pick and hold yourself。so Maybe it's not necessarily that good because其实里面那么简单，你不是这个mbti那那几个维度，其实你比这个回答多了。so personality is useful it's important but also it's not everything。
There's much more to you than just personality and there's much more to your personality than just these dimensions。remember if you go back to last class，we talked about research right？it's not a good model If I Say so。what is personality？I have a list of three thousand dimensions，right？and if you take my ten thousand question test you'll find out how you score these就使用这个right it's too long，too complicated so you want something that will capture the key dimensions。
And can capture the key features we must recognize that is a simplification right？remember what is a model is a simplification is an abstraction so don't say you know for yourself also right？我就是一个内向的人，我不适合对don't say that OK，you can change yourself，you can control behavior not so simple。also when you see other people right，we see a team members。
Don't vision hold that close all this time，OKI want to many teams and also I understand and see too，right？Oh dear，他就就偷懒，而这个就对吧。very easy to make these mistakes。
为什么？但是我在这个时间。
Now I was talking about right，the all we feel is always changing is always new technologies always change by using these personalities to measure personality。
And we're talking about，I think so I mentioned，right，you mentioned that we have actually，what about AI？what if we have big data because I have a big data research right？you've been very surprised，you know a lot of the companies that work with you know，right II know all you're like all the employees，right？他们所有开会都开开，那个录音也开始在who's talking what you're saying you can see都能看见right everything you can see，right？do big data and。
Analyze this。so do you want to think about using big data and AI to measure personality change？do you think you'll make more useful你刚才说的话，那如果AI可以非常的基于那个机关，那每天的那个几万天的那个可以真的是决定你这个人就是这样的，就现在是any other problems AI有什么？
Ethical concern，privacy，privacy，issues privacy。so if you're personality is like uploaded under the Internet，who knows what will happen？
And like you can，you can have your。
Photo uploaded for the Internet，------------ ---------------- does not reflect your personality，and if in some days，AI can material your personalities through your like facial moves like and it means their data stored on the Internet and that's AI mean，I think that poses a stretch our privacy，but what if I use only a public post right？so？
微博你是公开的这个互动或者是extracted data，我没有说是我不是volunteer对吧？你自己发的谁让你发朋友圈的对吧？
所以说you raise the comment，do you think it's okay to use personality if you use very，very fine detailed data，do you think in that case it's okay to use it for assessment，I think就是说用现有的for for the the the data existed on the social media was that public experiences I don't think the data is enough to train that AI that can make consistent？
To to the the person that causes that information。so Maybe that is not not the threat。
People。
Very very accurate。they are very fine，grained and awesome beer。
People don't。
Present all their。他们怎么可以解决这个假日的话隐藏是吧？然后逮逮动的修every actions，publicly。
So they will。
但假如可以解决就是假如这个。
Another question，right？so another question，right。so I remember I mentioned，right？if you look at some of the problems of personality。
We talked about social desirability bias faking good results right so I go personality test to be a salesperson。you might try very hard to make yourself so you know agreeable extroverted these other dimensions，but if you know that everybody is using AI now，we're using big data so don't you have to take your test。
但是to always be trying to make a good impression it's a pihee，when he thought it knew how always making the cooling fashion and that is，that is who you are。
That is no difference between the authentic personality is the make up one。
也是一个trade是一个固定的吧，那只有这个固定的trade我可以做一些behavioral difference，我们是掌握对吧？如果我说我是一个逆向的人，就是我对孝顺，我可以表现和外向，所以就说我们是看那个成因子还是具体的行为表现，那假如说不过可以随时监督你，对吧？那你是不是随时做这个案例，但是他说我能能够装一辈子吧，能有谁在乎他到底是不是那样的，但是怎么说你可以被人对吧？你还是没那么高啊。
表现出来，结果是一样的，这个就是你。就算从评价角度来讲，他的性格也是那样，就是说就是会有那个低表现，对吧？你本身可能是一米八对吧？你地表现一米八三，那那你说你到底个子多多高，你说我随时一背，你垫脚尖，我是不是一米八三？是的，所以这个挺有意思对吧？那你让我随时进两千，我就是一米八三吗？
但是如果贴车处上就是一米八。
这。然后，那我可能是。
一米八的人你先去垫个脚是不是一辈子挺难受的？你能不能一辈子垫脚啊？开玩笑啊。
Observation right now一个选择是我们刚才同事说就是十一隐藏于看着有时候想法坐下去but it's problematic right especially if there's more desirable personality traits in certain jobs。you know，do you always need to be constantly acting就是这没有特别好的问题，特别特别好的回答是随便一点，是不是我有一些privacy为什么right？
And certain situations。you should not be allowed to observe me right？because then I need to always be active。是不是？比如说那假如说如果我们这个销售也不需要什么关系啊？你说我所有工作场景的表情都是对外想的，每次扣的就是站起来唉打招呼对吧？那么在家里啊我在那个他在别的场上表现不是那样的，这可不可以啊？可以啊，那如果说那那你就说一些acting不是真的这样的，但是他就是天天。
外向，而且谁不打招呼啊，你就是往公司这样的acting，那是不是应该看你的看法不一样哇，往哪过呀？
会不会不会？老板，你看，应该是。
What I'm doing my home我看你发微信啊，你不怎么发微信啊。他天天发微信，天天跟别人互动啊。
这个哎呀，你这是在在工作online how much being expirated online doesn't mean，you're exorbitant no in the Real World and also be introverted online does not mean that you are introverted in the Real World，I could possibly interact with people。freely in the class and in other places，and also does not send Wechat。no polls are in like a month。I think that's pretty normal and I just did find a problem with this，yeah，so once again，right。然后另外一个比如说你在工作。
五个月在在微信上活跃，那什么团建那个活跃啊对吧？是不是说不定就I'm joking，right，but it is quite all Mad。if you have a big day of AI right with the person I can't name it's easier right for my boss I'll be a nice person。I'll be very agreeable very extroverted customers right it's a much more bounded only of AI everything in your big data it kind of becomes an unbounded situation you know你是不是一辈子见到家人？
There's no correct answer就没有个绝对的什么以后怎么样。but something to think about you know and then can you use personality and then what are the limits of personality testing。you know，can we have to look at certain contexts，right？can we say that well II do the right kind of behavior in my company，right？but at home，why怎么样怎么样，你不能管我right so it's something to think about，especially as we have more and more access to data。
So as we're talking about right？
These are radio tendencies，那是那个本身的那个本身就是就是就是偏好，对吧？------------ ------------ situation right，你是什么样的情况？also motivation right these can ---------------- influence this另外一个是你的情绪，right if you're happy，我们跟逗号玩一下吧，然后这个要毕业了对吧，毕业了谁都会回家就躲开呀，肯定是大家都出去嗨一嗨right。
So you know your actual behaviors are different than your personality it's not just as who you are。necessarily directly predict，how you behave this can vary，and after many other factors that will affect this so that they were personalized important it's stable it does predict behavior but it's only part of the story there's all other things going on here so once again right tendencies ------------ ------------ specific behavior is comfortable。
Any questions I see，MA？
So。你可以想一想right so，假如说how would you use personality in the company right？so，假如说assume you're a team manager，okay，刚好比如说你是一个学生，你要选一个团队啊，做一些比如说一个大的作业，假如说写个OB课的大作业啊，team a team B，so this is even more like you know。
Countries to come to our quiet right就比较细心的人。they like to work with。他们细心，他们是比较准时。so Maybe Sometimes Sometimes太在意这些小细节，那另外一条就是尼泊尔对吧？就是那些怎么说学霸就是比较宅的一些朋友啊，因为另外一个朋友啊，他是比较right，但是又一些，然后但是有一些就是刚才就是那个学学法学对吧？就是比较。
另外一个是一个就比较综合的一个团队，就是right。
But。他们确实心里有点儿不一样。which team do you think you prefer。假如说如果安排你我把你拍了这道题，你没办法，那你怎么提高效率啊？有没有想法吗？就比如说学吧学，但是比较单独干事情的学霸学另外一个是不是叫which team would you rather work in。
Anybody want那个学霸什么？
唉，为什么我上次说的呢？你自己说的对吧？我们说一个小组一个人，他这个学霸才能担当对吧？你自己一个人做，我就那个站台对吧？你不要这个群吗？没有favorite吗？
然后我们不是假如说if you're at the very conscientious当时很细心的事情，难道他们是更好组织吗？比如说然后分配工作，比如说我给你一，每个人一个模块，我保证你肯定干啥对吧都不行吧。
还还那还还不要那学霸学吗？
No。no。
啊，至少有一个anybody no，I surprise，I thought everyone，be team one，no，I said people like the next team。so why？why would you want the diverse team？
就是直到if I choose TOTTTOA and then it's the outcome it all depends on the leader。the all depends on the leader。if the leader cannot generate an innovative idea，and then the，uh，the whole project goes to the wrong way，你不能分工吗就知道什么意思。you need a leader to to assign their their tax。
我知道，但是我就是意思就是说如果要是都是a的话，就是他们如果都不都不去对大规划提出自己的意见，and then这个这个对组长来说，他的任务就是如果他不能制定一个肯创新的一个建议和那个整个小组就是所以刚才说的第二个题，对吧？对，所以当TA的组长要听B的组长。
队长，高考，但就是你的成绩就是这个的二点儿二二点儿五倍呀，对吧？就是你是按照那个排名多不好并扣分啊，多的好给你加分，你这个我一定是跟leadership approach，就那个学霸学和那个mixed。
就是你为什么当leader，你不要说那个具体的不是不要说你比如说我有没内心那样的什么什么绝对不用啊，就是你这怎么这么这么就有这个听力啊，这么这个听力啊。
嗯，你想我，嗯。
然后whole task，and I think they can do it by themselves，they by themselves oh，and they handed me and kept it。and I choose the best one to hand in。哦，这个意思。so you have each to by themselves。
Anybody else主要是听B你们怎么治？这是这个church难一点有mixed有外向有什么内向内向，这个都不一样，那个那个那个team怎么怎么样we have learned in the strategic management，there are two kinds of strategies。
The delivery the strategy and Secondly it's emerging strategy。that means the emergency strategy that means the strategy is generated depends on the。
As the project goes on就是随，就是随机的就是生成这个这个建议，而不是说不是宣传。我记得你第一节课是英文名儿，好像是那个学校，你不是说放在编程一个人在做工作对吧？
因为yes that so said Maybe the deliberate strategy is more suitable for the team a because there's no other team members to challenge your idea but in a team B since they are many experts participants and then you can expect them to take part into the discussion and generate more innovative ideas that's interesting point and I think we'll talk about this when we go to the group level right？it's interesting right，we have formal leadership，right？
Leadership emergence，well，I know Tom，you have emergency strategy，right？Maybe we don't say no I'm the boss I tell you what to do，right？we say no，as it unfolds就是谁比较这个可以听到这个right so it's different approaches，but I think Maybe it's easier to do the team a leadership right？TV is a more complicated right because you have to do a different personalities so Maybe there's also，you know，Maybe introvert you will feel that you're pushing too much or actually will feel that you're not communicating。
So that could be a problem of a team of different personalities is conflict but Hollywood team a Maybe is that就没有什么可创新的？他们都是学霸，作业就挑啊。然后就是very very well the same approach so we can have really breakthrough ideas Maybe not so much for two more we're going to have a breakthrough you publish a paper if you have all the same people，比如说就是你同学同学肯定not the best。
So it's important to think about personalities and also when you're teamwork，you know，how do you manage your personalities？do you think when you treat your team members，do you understand people that are similar to you understood that different from you？
What did这个问题啊，不是问那个课堂能力啊，需要你思考一下，一会儿要学那个穿，这样你选那个team member，你这个性格匹不匹配啊，这个以后你知道这个人他怎么样？那那怎么好好合作？important real question for you to do your homework。so you know，I said all these are very applicable to your job，but also to your class word。
So kind of just going over this，you know，you can look at this later。this is a key points for when you review the materials basically，you know？
Personal is important for us to complicate you know gesture personality so you know you can look at this and also realize that yourself assessment is Maybe different than how others assess，you and public you're more biased than other people。
So one question，right？I have a few different sections，so do you like to have one big break or do you like to have，like a couple of smaller breaks like，how do you like to have the class set up？有一次休息吗？还是比如说就这两次？
Opinions，anybody。
就是有一些我听说很多人那个我说我毕业之后我要干嘛？就是因为我当时我毕业之后就是上学院的，我们不可能要去那个投行咨询公司啊，那个私募对吧？对同基金就叫做私募私募私募。
你不是私募吗？
你私募基金私人私人的私。
这应该知道吧啊，知道不是说我当时就算做这个事情啊。然后听说现在很多人都是可能毕业后想考研还是什么对吧？有没有读博士啊？当然就academia personality a problem with personality research is there is a lot of frameworks OK，so if you want to make a big impact right like are you going to make another MBTI？
Don't worry，we really have big five don't worry we have dark triad。we have dark triad don't worry we have many other small other frameworks right？so I'm going to go over the frameworks but I can't go over all of them because there are a lot of frameworks。you know，some of the main ones are Mayo Briggs，right？the big five，this is big five Plus a little bit more right。
Dark triad。so if you want to make a kind of like a very big contribution，那现在已经有这么多，那个大的框架已经贡献就是你的空间在哪儿？right，so they said in OB。然后就是general。if you go return to research in general，if you go to new areas like，you know AI or you know aging，population aging workforce，right？these questions did not exist before。
So does not pre existing frameworks。but if you want to do you know leadership，right？charismatic leadership right authentic leadership many so personality is even more is even more entrenched就是比较固定的and you can see if you look right now at the age of these citations they're very，very old，The Original frameworks so you know how hard it is to make a new contribution anyways we need to learn them it's important to know the foundations right because you use personality in your research。
But you say I'm，a personality researcher，then realize you need to be kind of competing with all these pre existing frameworks。
So MBTR nineteen sixty two，right，so Maybe your parents were born。Maybe not right？
So，this was by this Briggs doctor Briggs and Meyer。
Basically。the idea is that your personality affects decision and these are supposed to be basically stable right over to your nature的那个perspective I'm not going to go into this too much because I think you all probably know MBTI it's very like you know it's it's look how many personnel basically it's like a hundred questions，you get a personality type right？typology就是说你是哪个类？
Remember，this is a typology，right？this is a bit different。I should go up big five it's a spectrum。我不说你是那种人，我是说你是多少分and it's very very popular。I am not sure this is correct。I meant to go back。
But anyways it's very common like we'll use it and for our team building personnel development。
I'm not gonna go into this too much detail，and you can read it for yourselves。but you know，introverted extroverted，right，你是外向的thinking versus feeling。
And I'll go to。we still have to come these right？but basically so extrovert introverted right these oh sorry，so I'll go back there。so the key point about this is these are all pairs right now the two buckets so you go into one of the main buckets for each dimension就是一个维度啊。每个维度它是有两个分类，你是那个还是这个so the first one is interverse。
所以。
Talk a lot very。this is very easy to understand what this is。one of the more easier to understand dimensions。basically，you know，are you very social by yourself？more and this will affect。so the definition may not so important and this may understand ------------ ------------ workplace implications this affects how you communicate right you refer to talking person or do you have to use written also how to write offices or then who do we assign to which projects，this is what you might want to consider this dimension。
So for instance。
We talked about。如果我们是安排作作业if I find out that everybody here is very introverted，Maybe if I want to get the best grades for all of you right？then we should have individual homework。如果想培养，你们可能是还上teamwork so anyways，but as a team，right？as a company，如果我需要提供你的体校right，那对学生individual homework for interpreted people，------------ ---------------- always emphasize a spectrum so don't just it's not just you are just have a person，right？
This was a little bit harder。to understand sensing versus Intuition I had this picture and sensing is。
就不要具体的concrete right，what is like you know一一十一二十二我看见就是这个Intuition is more abstract so as your research right，I like to think abstract right。I take this information now what do I想到？这些东西我可能讲不通啊，right，反正是。
比如说如果我是偏学代码的，我是那个十分的多，那Maybe那个三级would be better，right，but it's not right theory，Maybe it's better to have Intuition so this one is also，you know，没有什么好的不好，right，------------ -------------------- are different ways to approach it when you understand your world。
There's a thinking versus feeling once again，you know，this is Maybe you should understand you should。这种感情还是那个就是就是cognition right what's the how to make decisions also Maybe how do we do a conflict right that we're going to try to convince you to do something emotional heal or do I use many more database more factual judgmental tools。
And then this one is also。
This thing where that you management，right，or the way we kind of。
Job design就可能不要骗那些管理类的那些因素可是多一点right do I like to have you know making decisions or more flexible adoptable。
So once again，you know，these are these are neither good nor bad。I think what's important about these different dimensions is that it's not an absolute，but it is something be careful about because you want pigeonhole right？我说什么样的人适合做什么样的工作，因为我们看到网上有很多这些这个分类高清未来的一些职业发展什么什么的，就是没有说是那个绝对好，绝对不好。
啊，many areas right team leadership also，what type of people？how did they adopt to change if you look at the judgment or reflexible or more deciding。what is the right way to do things？Maybe you know sorry with the team leadership right？should the strategy unfold over time，or should the step strategy from the beginning？
So this is where you know mbti has been used to business areas。
But some key issues with it is，you know，is it is it a very good predictor is reliable and also，as I mentioned mayhem，is it forcing to be a certain type that's what's the spectrum so This is why I'm absolutely not a new fan of my ETI it's not bad if you lose it，but Maybe if you're on your research，you should look at different types of measures。
I don't talk about too much because I think you know this，and I think it's not the most interesting one I like this one more the big five model so this is more。I personally feel this is more Maybe grounded in solid research approaches it's it's you know statistics it's also talks about continuous rather than a certain type and it's quite strong at predicting the outcomes就是那个预测性比较强。
So this one，Maybe you are，have you used this before？do you know these different dimensions？so so very clear this is called ocean or canoe right so openness to new experiences？
Conscientiousness extraversion就是那个extroversion agreeablableness就是不是好说话。so these I think are generally so equivalence generally is good to be more agreeable extroversion it can be good or bad openness experience or bad but neuroticism这是比较稳定的那个不太好的一个维度就是这个说是一个情绪稳定的人就一般来说你很难说哦，这些工作适合情绪不稳定的人。
一般。
就比如说你看这个工作比较适合那个比较比较坚定的人，就是比较就不太喜欢那个new experience，就是可能你这边就不太new experience就好干的一份工作对吧？so obviously是好的constitution应该是一般来说还是比较好，就我不太希望那个有那些state明显是不太好，但是虽然你可能性格比较neurotic对吧，但是能够控制自己，你想做啥？
啊，所以这个spectrum right and大部分角色是don't assume，假设这个normal distribution。
像就是你知道吧是balker right就是不会说是就是那个height或者weight就是normally distributed in the population。这个明白吧，就你像那个就标准叫什么，那叫标标准那个还有中文网怎么说normal。
这就是这样的。
对正在发布啊thank you and then they offer independently，OK，所以就是说a little bit different about this is hookah MBTI，right，they say oh，you are entp ENFJ，right unless you go combination make sure this type of person independent dimensions。
Now once again，you can do these different type of tests to measure yourself super ratings。
So extraversion，这个不用找太多。it's quite similar，right are you all going or you're more quiet that's crazy you understand？
Conscientiousness。这就是像那些仔细的做事情，right，所以organize are you a liable这么文明就是做事情比较靠谱啊。right。
那就说一般事儿就cooperation比较好对吧？let me get less flexible right Maybe they are more spontaneous so for instance。
If you want to choose an artist就是像那个艺术家不是就是一个就是那个演员Maybe you want somebody who is Maybe it's not as important to the contest person，but I think John is speaking it's quite useful to be more conscientious right so you can follow rules you're on time，right？especially as a student you know shouldn't get to score the time it's not Sometimes I can't change it就是比较那个靠谱的差不多的意思。
Agreeableness this one，I think generally want more agreeable people right？就是比较就是那个比较配合别人就是比较好说话的。那当然if you want to be negotiated right in the谈判，你只有一个的那个律师。
你对课肯定有规模对吧？但是如果是那个谈判是还可以的可以的对吧？差不多Maybe not right。
So it's a negotiation status conflict management，right？so in a team Maybe it's good to have more agreeable people but will be creative and everybody just agrees and你说什么都可以了，我们都都写进去了。
Maybe not right？
Now we're going to unagree much是不是闹翻了也不行了。so Maybe it's good to be a mixture of personalities？so consider right。
And this one，you know，generally speaking we won't have more calm you're比较稳定。that就是标准那个你说就是就是不着急的这边anxiety是这个客厅电视，这个是不是着急啊，要是容易不能着急，特别容易焦虑啊，就是情绪不会就是不稳定啊，所以这个是因为a lot of people could not be freaking out freaking out better so。
If you had no stress，do you have a change？do you have a conflict，do you make good decisions。几乎我们，我想象到有什么情况，你希望位置上有情绪度稳定，一旦说就就没有什么好的，那当然。
Spectrum，so you know with emotion stability you can't have like a perfectly stable person，right？------------ ------------ idea is that you want to be more stable。so again，all these things are spectrums，right？
And open this to experience this is you know，you're curious，are you creative？you don't try new things or would you like to be more traditional传统习惯？
And this will affect creativity also，can you accept new change also，can you be trained就是这个他能不能学会新的东西，但是这个就fixing their ways。
身体of all kind of important，dimensions。
So once I was kind of two main frameworks right？we just talked about METI and we talked about big five，so any questions about these two would be pretty easy to understand。
Okay，but beyond that，there are many different other types，right？some of these are going to be less common，like eighty personality I don't want to see people using that very much。
There are some more common ones that are like course such evaluation don't try it South monitoring risk making so we're going to need something？
Now here's how the problem right is we're doing theoretical work or we're doing New York research work right？if we just say I use MBTI to predict this outcome Maybe somebody's already done that right？MBTI predicts you know sales performance。
So you know，how do you find a inducing topic to talk about？Maybe if you use a different framework，right？and then you casino，what is the specific workplace outcome so we're going to risk taking right？so MBTI可能不太适合做这个，就是说那个做那个投行是不是敢不敢去找项目的，我不是说是那个外向或者是不是那种那个是不是thinking还是什么什么交警，right，这跟平时你敢不敢冒险你就投资冒险挺好。
Animals taking is Maybe a more economics，right？we talk about risk。preference right？这个水果吧，这风险偏好你学过经济学吗？微观经济学啊。
可能就那个能接受风险的程度不一样。
是risk matter with neutral，right，so Maybe you are talking about risk taking outcomes it's more useful to use this tendency。
这样，这是一个机会，对吧？你说，哦，其实这个结果很符合现在的一些所谓的空调，我有一个新的一个框架，就比如说risky，就比如说我说那个provided我是不是主动性啊。so that's not how you can make a contribution you may find some outcomes that are perhaps unique right and you find some new frameworks to help explain those。但是你别想自己也很聪明，作为世界很多人，中国的世界。
是一个很重要的，就是主动的那些行为，那是不是风险，是不是会那个控制自己的，对吧？但是大家都会想这些有趣的奥特曼出自己的空调，所以有时候想一个新的奥特卡，然后是一个是新的空调，所以不容易的OK，就是。
It's quite difficult to personnel就是。当然we may talk about you know like positive and negative outcomes，right，you know，I think personality trade。然后比如说比如说那个championship leadership有很多那些不好的那些我们的dockside那些东西，这是比较一个exciting比较是一个套路对吧？就是dark side这个词。
Also，you can talk about interaction。以后我们讲的是这样，其实已经做很多研究。如果是personality research，你不是光看这个personality会导致什么的结果肯定是说personality in this environment in this context right and we'll talk about that later in the class today about the importance of person environment fit这个我觉得是比较有趣的，这是一个pick respect。
So we just have a just pure personality，right？Maybe it's not as interesting in these days。if there's a person you know say somehow的事情，right？it's much more of a nuance perspective。
So we go come very quickly on the alternative，then Maybe I'm not too honest with you I'm never use this schedule for this one is a bit newer it's nineteen ninety Seven是不是你们应该出生的吧？有一些人出生了吧都没出生吧？
You look at the history，right？so this is like a nineteen emiti is nineteen sixty two，you got the sixty two right？then we go to more recently with the artifacts in here。this is like more recently，more recent，let me get to the really recent one，which is this course evaluation I said it's very recent right but it's still pretty old nineteen seventy Seven。
So this is more about like。
Self esteem some efficacy locusts control。
These social我没做过这个这块研究but it's basically another way to an analyze but some advocacy，for instance，is so now we're going from Pandora，right？this is Pandora is a very famous person in OB你听说过吗？就是。
Very important，he made a social visit，social cognitive theory we talked about interaction，the person the environment and their beliefs but very kind of core part of his framework，right？她已经不在了，她应该是前年就是就不在了，因为self efficacy this is very important，it's basically，你觉得你自己行不行？就是说我不知道我自己能不能干，我能成功，我能做出也是这样，那这是很重要的。这。
能不能做这个事情就听见是不是很简单对吧？你觉得我不行，肯定不行，right？but if you believe in yourself。不是不那种真的就是这种能力啊，你就别有人能做出啊。
So it's about task specific这件事情能不能做，然后就说他是social cognitive比较就是他那个他的，然后这个self advocacy是个非常强的一个particular就是经常会预测就是能不能成功，他又可以预测很多东西啊，所以这个是一个比较，但是这是这是一个一个变量。so if you notice right，this is not a framework it's not a five but self efficacy itself is a。
Specific code，right。
No，I can need you to be more effective for your goal achievement。
And then also increase performance。then another important concept that I think right？and once again，if you notice you're right we're shifting from target is big framework you get into more specific aspects of personalities。so I think we talk about the specific aspect of deeper conversation right？sorry about you know，do you believe in your ability to do things？another point is because focus on control，this is a very old idea by this very important which talks about，you know，why do things happen？
就是你生活中的一些结果是因为你自己导致的吗？你是不是因为是外国的因素？
The fundamental，Attribution error right。we talk about how people tend to think that bad things are because of other as external，right，which we're called the Hall，因为那个就老师出的题太难对吧？为什么他老婆因为我学习的复习的段位啊，那些是is generally speaking do you tend to think that you are causing things to happen or think that things are happening to you，就是说你是被动的还是主动的this is或者这是一个在新的层面会。
就比较静态的那些个例子。
So，if you have an internal focus就是你觉得你是导致这些结果。你是一般觉得是我自己主动的事情，那你像你happy jobs do better and more prior to don't and more leadership ability but your external一般来说your higher stress less satisfaction。所以一般来说，我们自己有这个自主的这些态度，我们觉得我们自己能导致自己那个就是说and we think we can influence our outcomes in life，right，so。
We control the outcomes and with the ability self efficacy all right，我这我这个能力，而且是我要控制的。generally speaking this is positive for your work performance and your happiness。
那那个听说过吧。this is more interesting，right，this is kind of an interesting part where the dark side so dark triad。
就是那个American cycle知道吗？
就是做投行的一个原则，因为这个不清楚就是做投行，他就是那个做反卷，因为他是那个做一些比较亏的东西啊。anyway he，he，he shows the doctor，very clearly very，very，very psychopath，right，so。
Basically if you want to see it's kind of in action it's called American cycle very famous Christian about that right？we're not about that just after so basically Machiavellian is this three hundred quorum，components you're all bad things，right？so I said，you know，a trend is kind of a dark side of personality some people，naturally have are say bad personality have these negative aspects and what's important right？
Is this implies that some people may be just naturally have some negative behaviors based on personality I'm going to天上的有些或者说问题对吧？那可能确实有一些dark那些方面and This is why is it bad because these tend to be too counterproductive your bad work behavior would unethical behavior？
So does machtivelleism this is based on this Nicole Nicole machiavelli听说吗？知道吧。
就是比较清楚的对就比较use other people right对so basically。
So Maybe it's good on some of the right？Maybe these are people are better at the strategic and how they form alliances。
So Maybe it's good for their own progress，but do you want to be friends with this type of person that Maybe also your political right？so if you're watching others and in my mind，it's going to be not as bad as the other one，they don't want to be much worse right then one is narcissist。
Psychopath这个这个honest with you so mockingbillism I don't see it very often psychopathy II don't think I really ever see this used in OB research because it's very，very，very some very common right psychopath去用那个一个psychopath中文怎么说吗？
那就是对别人就没有没有外号的一个就是they have no feeling no empathy就是一年一年都没有那个同情别人就一直都不能同情，就是那种就看别人再怎么样也无所谓，那那些人就basically you won't see this very often research but it's part of the dark triad and basically就是可能讲他内心有没有对别人没有感情。
So this is not good，right？不同，这个关键是什么？是一个personality level就是不是说他们学了他们就是这样的人就是天生的可能就是比较或者是做年龄乐趣的时候就会变成没有感情的人。so this is what's again，Maybe not something as common in research，but it's part of the dark triad。this one I think is important when we talk about a lot。
This is Maybe why I talk about a doctor，right？is this is a very common theme narcissism right？this is。
行为这个二线的知识指点对吧？we'll talk about our cystic behavior是什么意思？特别是比如说领导对吧？是不是领导就是你们自私的，是不是有一些什么情况，比方说自私的行为。so for instance right if I let you decide how to divide work and we should刚好给自己少点分工对吧？那如果是说你长期啊，就是做那些decision maker就可以做那些自私的行为。
This is a very important question，actually。
And then also，you know，就是export对吧？然后also Maybe what they have entitlement就是这样应该的是吧？
So this is actually quite important to have a self promotion credit taking有时候出出结果怎么分配的一个结果，因为比如说我是不是给自己分蛋糕给自己多一点吧。
嗯，does it affect charismatic leaders right，是不是跟那些所谓的比较好的表现是不是有correlation就是对就是相关性对吧？对，这个是不是就是跟以前我们所有的认认识好的东西你是不是有相关的，所以这个national。
And something like that，right？they said they were helping become a good leader。also came to correlate with narcissism source and I think it's a very important point，you know，so especially when we talk about top managers it's an important consideration。
所以这个就这个算了，这个时间now another point of topic is to self monitoring。so we talked about right can we control how we perform how we express our personalities in different situations so I'm monitoring只是我们是不是呢管好了自己啊。so what is my self regulation那么控制the monitoring is aware we're observing so this is nineteen seventy four right so if you have a high stuff monitor这。
对自己的那个观察比较强你看见哦，我这个行为。
是怎么样的？反正唉，我拿着more effectively adapt to a situation。for instance，if you see old today I'm wondering where the job to be a sales person while I adapt my behavior to your act Moore's extrovert if you're able to adapt how you behave through fitness situation，they'll often allow you to have better outcomes。
A mistake in a spokesman，right？this is perhaps more easy to understand it's much for common economics right there。also affects innovation entrepreneurship就是你敢不敢创业also can you make decisions such as financial order safety decisions。
Additionally we also will affect。you know，how do we design governance systems就是我们那个公司治理有时候考虑到这个风险也好。
这是这方面你现在so what I'm going to try now is something forty topics right not necessarily for like these are individual I'd say point interventions of personality so such as proactive personality是不是自主性right are you wanting to。
嗯，for article four and remember the first class I took about how we have extroverted leadership，so you know，as I found out in that article about the branch actually for the leadership，is there not so good？when you're a team of proactive people without any自主性很强。然后我这种外向的。我说，唉，大家我给你走一下，一看就相当于大家是谁吧，自己干好事情，你可能不希望我过来就是，哎呀，跟我废话，然后就是那个软件啊，什么什么的，看到还。
自助力很强的人像那个18个月去Maybe your effect how they how they interact with each other。
所以呢，就是刚才Maybe we just talked about is就是。
MBTI，we talked about big five talk about dark triad，so if you feel a little bit tired，then Maybe it's very normal because a lot of different frameworks。a lot of different areas in personality。
快进来kind of go back to Steve all these different jobs，right？a sales，so what？the scientists working in finance may be HR manager，no，what type of personality traits we think be most useful。so when we do research right？there's a lot of different X variables a lot of different y variables right so you know this is a different y variables right performance，但是这种我们这样contextualized对吧？所以说我们肯定要。
导致好的业绩right？那什么叫好的业绩是销售的业绩，还是像那个创新业绩嘛？那是不是那个HR那个就是说那个啊，people's oppression so these are outcomes right and then what？types of personality access right？刚才我们讲的就是说的是X right if you look right，this is this is X right for active percentage you don't X click on结果。
X right这音也就是那个就是那个解释变量。
So what X's do you think would be most useful for explaining these different wives right？
Now，what do I ask you to do？this is because when you think about this，right？
We do research oftentimes？we have a new lie，right？so first of all，we forget that right？so I'm going to sales representative center right on these different personalities we talked about what do you think would be likely to predict，you know，positive performance and what I think would be likely to predict less good performance，比如说。
啊，是一个比如说，那你说比如说你说那个。
就是你说那个self monitoring you think that's very applicable就是会不会就是老看自己就是不是看自己行为。
Maybe less applicable for understanding sales performance。就比如说如果是比如说你感觉这个不是直接相关，那它就不讨论那个变量，对吧？那比如说。
Narcissism Maybe narcissism is useful for sales，right？我就抢客户了。我就是我这不客气了对吧？就自己该该得就该得对吧so Maybe it's helpful scientists，right？I mean scientists will benefit from self efficacy right from other practical personality right？因为你自主性比较强的。
Also，Maybe，you know，having a strong internal self control。
Or friends of our career director。Maybe creative director is supported by，you know，an TJ supported by the what is it？the Intuition very less affected by something like the dark triad because无所谓啊。那你是creative。so The thing is when you make an argument，right，you just select the X variables and you select the wire variables and you can make it logically make。
So to explain，you know，I said that I think being a research scientist is positively affected by active personality why because终结变量right？because most of your work is individual work，right？and most of you work is high uncertainty because you don't want to be publishing right？so just in the argument so we're trying to expedite。
然后我的逻辑，是吧串在一起了。
所以说OK啊这句话understand so I give you a child。假如说whatever，we said about working as a。
An AIT，right？what type personalities were making more effective as being an AI team member working with it in the human AI team是比较适合跟AI作为这个知识体合作。
合作像这个团队，要不你个人就是说我给你一个AR，对吧？你是这是哪个性格会提高，会会那个预测，就是能好好用。恋爱问题就是这样。
因为。因为现在我就是那几个问题啊I do consulting work做一些咨询工作，就比如说一个联想或者novel right，they ask me now to help them do a project。
To help the managers。
就是可能要减少那个开始有这些筛选对吧？you just like some people right so，那当然旁边要问这个问题对吧？但是如果是说downsize，我们说我们需要选择谁留下，那可以留下就是AR的，因为我们需要AR的单词工作对吧？大家怎么选择把谁留下，那首先肯定要看到那个表现，那个肯定要看到怎么样对吧？那学校可从性格。
It is a possible personal levels that can predict could be more effective and using the AI。
嗯，over this experience哦，这可能会有right，so is the AI is a new experience and how do you use AI difference with your practice and there's a relatively new difference it's not a like a it's not like a procedure that is rigorous or define it is you must explore it export as potentials your your combination with payoff and。
High，very good。anybody else。what do you think any other，any other person I trace？I think，would predict your ability to be successful at using AI？
What about嗯？
But our conscientiousness。
就是就是比较细心靠谱的人靠不靠谱的也没关系吧。
Writing writing prompts writing prompts requires，Patience。
And conscienceness。那这有可能就是这个。
这有可能对有没有这里面有那个，因为我不是说什么东西，对吧？那你这里没有更有名词性的，比如说，毕竟那是一个or better predictor than perhaps you know a conscientiousness。
比如说what about locus of control，你觉得AI合作你需要这个internal case还是external Office。
这个我也不知道，就是说有可能是什么Maybe it's bad，because我就不愿意放手完事。按照我来说哎呀我就我就按照utilize AI because I'm not really to let go of control right？and I'm not going to accept the ai's input Maybe，but also Maybe I need to have a strong human guidance。
I don't know right so that's why it's important they've argued and then we hear testing right？understand each of high locals and before low locus of control and have them do experiment do do Taser the AI to see who performs better。
结构变量，这是performance或者AI，然后我们就可以找编译编译的逻辑，然后策略逻辑。我觉得为什么internal local control是好的，是因为。
是要命的。AI为什么这是不好的，因为这样的话我是少用AI的那个创新能力，这个是competing hypothesis。然后我们就这样做研究了，就其实不难啊，我们作为我们这个其实从一个理论层面很有味道，你就看一个X点，看y变量能不能把它讲通了，讲通了一个核心的那个过程是什么，其实越是比如说我说的越是leader就是越说是那个什么非常leadership，另外可能更偏那个。
嗯，他那个那个distance search information，但这个趋势就变一个X mechanism那y就是比较简单，所以说回答就是还是非要模型啊。
所以说刚才讲的是比较比较累的对吧？这东西是非常好。personality其实是确确实实是这样的，所以next Maybe this would be a little more interesting to value to judge when。
You干嘛？你们知道吧对吧？那就是那个张主任中国政府是两个人就要交费上对吧？要找照片那个服务器那个。
那你这驾照有用吗？有用有用有什么用吗？
家属是。
价格问题their work那比如说我让你价值观然后呢啊。
So anyway，I agree。I think that is very important，especially when we talk about cross cultural，right？because American in China I'm half Chinese right so it's really different but interacting with Americans there are the Chinese right it's very important ------------ ------------ same time Maybe you don't see it as often it's not like，you know，这个就是外商的，然后这个就是很紧张------------ \----------------\\\---- are all very Maybe this is a bit different，right？
Or society level and this is more specifically by like，what is the correct way to act？what is socially how you should act in the social settings？
So，these are still very stable and it is，you know，culture and social influence so it's different though these values are learning。
所以这个更偏那个nature verse nurture这样是比较偏nurture的你在这个环境长大right。
Also it's about what you think is important。
而且不是说是你这个不是的是一一般是怎么做，一般什么行为。so，this is more about what you what your priorities are supposed to you're actually beginning now of course，your priorities or culture behavior let's have a key difference so it's more about you know nurture and what we're focusing on what we think are the important outcomes。
So why is important is that the individual level，right？decisions。
Right this research on，you know ancient culture think about Chinese，you know，doing it for my family，right？你为什么努力工作？是不是你自己赚钱吗？你是不是为了养家，因为这是family work。比如说中国家庭对家庭企业，他们是不是在这个协和这个和谐社会啊，对吧？就是生命之间搞公司，国外是不是招生影响这个公司治理。
Also你看又给我们这个culture right look at what the ethical standards。and also what do we，how do we affect？you know what employees were hiring these are all affected by the values of the company by values individuals。
Show the setting up。
These are based on solid nurture right and as a result，these are less stable。even though that was a very stable，you know，for instance，if you go abroad you took国外国民大学不在国内I think your values would probably be quite different now for me I grew up in the USI finished my undergarden slays in the US and then I came in China，so I think living in China over the years has really changed my values you know I have much more Asian values now than did before。
So I'd say that values are very stable ------------ they're less stable than personality they do change more overtime。
Also for values we know where it isn't for conscious right就是比如说can you tell me what is some Chinese values中国教育观念你知道吗有吗中国中国教育观吗？有啊，社会主义核心价值观。
对呀，所以这个事情。
你看不会想的是，哎呀，今天作为一个外向的人，我怎么跟你说话对吧？感觉不会怎么说好对吧？感觉说一个中国人对吧，怎么跟你说啊，那么conscious thinking about我跟外国人说话，可能是这个要跟那样的说，肯定说跟这样的说不，你不会说是哦，跟一个内向的人跟外向的人就you don't think so much这样的意思。
So you know，what's here，right？kind of the structure of the class we're going to very fundamental personality let me move more towards behavior right？so this is perhaps less deep than personality but still very stable very deep now。we'll talk about Instrumental and terminal terminal is of end state就是说what is the purpose of everything最终的那张主管就比如说我们教育问题是要专家写对吧？
就是最重要的，自己赚到钱不是最重要的，是社会和谐社会啊，是不是家庭开心啊？还有是不是比如说那个要那个最harmony right，或者是要freedom，或者是那个comfortable right，或者是要公平的right，these are all，你不会说什么，通过得到公平我们就可以这么讲，对吧？我开始说通过我们这个公平的，通过分配资源，我们可以作为公平的结果。第四道是我们这种的结果。
那当然这么多这些结果就是Instrumental values。
So，for instance，if our goal，our terminal goal is to make as much money right as well，right then Maybe we cannot ambition。so if we care about the wealthy and comfortable，then Maybe as Instrumental goal as instrumented value we value very ambitious。people are very motivated people very encourages people who are willing to work hard，right？
But Maybe if we care about，for instance，having a fair and Maybe safe society right？they require responsibility。
But。为什么我们在这个有责任心，不是说有责任心，但是为什么有责任心是好的，是因为导致一个安全公平的社会，但是为什么说是哦，最后就是真的是OK了，所以说就是你是通过他得到那个terminal。
就明白吗？嗯？
But something has been important，too。is the differential values can Maybe all support the same terminal value。so，for instance，right？if you always make as much one Asian can，right？if you want to have well，the ambition courage independence are all supporting that so these are more mechanism so your local mechanisms that support the same outcome。
Now another two times generational values so。我感觉老师不是文化跟他们的价值观but also另一个挺清楚嘛对吧，你跟你爸妈就这样说不一样吧。so for instance do you think there's any differences between your generations values and your parents有没有什么招数不同吧？像中美对吧？这个地方比较。
现在这个年代和你这么年代有没有什么价值观不同？
嗯，比如说。
我这挺好奇的因为这边the same generation，Maybe I'm like Maybe I'm one generation I love you，probably啊，就是我应该不是跟你同一大洋，应该是跟你在在高一届嘛。
就我也没有什么标准答案，我也不知道，就说你们这，你们现在这个年代的人跟你长辈啊，不就是包括你看我们这个，嗯，不公平吧，跟你讲装备啊，你别说抓不到自己啊，有吗？有，就比如说没有核心的核心的。
我觉得我代替我无所谓。
你看为什么我说我们说完这个我看一下，我说为什么我们就那个研究研究微距离precise，right last I'm not actually not to actually我不认得是什么意思啊？你可以跟我说一下具体点吗？具体的不是你家人的问题。
高科目还是怎么说我觉得无所谓你什么意思啊？
就死亡生活在那不是。
话倒也是对的，各位都是要死的，52是天命去世啊，或者我们之后，嗯，那种啊，可能给他插管的那个那种过度医疗让他延长寿命扩展，你看就现在就是像那些或者哎，我是非常非常的喜欢，这很有趣的，right，so。
就是我们说这些以后你为什么把这些观点作为一个研究型的？假如说你说那个就是那个干活这个好像该该不在就不在，对吧？那个是那个那个他还是太抽象，那位数是要不要查那个吸管什么东西，那吸管，吸管吸收吸管。
Anyways you know what I mean，right？
We're just two concrete right？hey，这就是这很重要的啊。so right，你刚才说是true abstract right，他抽上了说该不该再就是干一些对吧？你猜猜具体啊，你不行。so if you're my last class，I saw about the parsimony right？I want to find this middle area where we talk about something that is generally applicable。
But also it's not just空话，right？
Sorry you could talk about is Maybe in this situation，那这个当然是我们做笔录的一个很大的一个贡献。然后就是。
Move to Tim work right？a big part of my job as a theorist is to come up with Words，right？or if the ancients and we come with a new terms right？so how do we explain this right？it's very interesting point。so你不要那么具体啊。就那个那太具体了，你不能是空话。所以我也想啊，你这个词如果能编个词，what would you call this right？
啊，就这些肯定跟大问题了。给这个价值观造一个新词，怎么造对，因为我们要找这个价值观，所以你肯定会找一个你要解释的意思。
那就是说it's not opened to experience，right it's not always experience SOS结尾Let It be Sir。然后另外一个问题是什么？so is this about locus of control is Maybe acceptance of external locus of control。
不不不不不，我这样不是logos of control我讲的是，比如说。
We accept this那这个是一个很本质的一个区别，我跟你讲这个look at the control，这就会导致什么是need to argue this right while my idea right now why your idea of this accepting external events right why this is something new and it's something different and argue Maybe we say at the previous generation，right？they value high internal locus of control and this current generation。
We have lower value of internal local control。instead，we have a tendency to external locus of control这一块呢挺有trade的对吧？就是说location control perception will change over generation。这句话很有趣啊。so anyways right？正常的意思是说。
我们需要讲我觉得新概念是出在哪儿对吧？让他们别的概念有什么区别的？那这个是就是超过你课外就是又超超越我们当时聊的，对吧？对。
There's different generation of differences and it will change our understanding。remember I said right obese evolving she ever used to always think high focus of controlling journals to control is good，right？but Maybe as you said，if we'll do that什么都要控制对吧？哪怕有这件事必须争，必须争，让他搞得他真的很不愉快，没有工作机会什么什么对吧但Maybe our previous understanding of local control is wrong in this current context so I said，obviously interesting，so。
东西没准可以写一个动文但是必须要把这个develop对吧？你说讲它跟别的不一样，它为什么出现，为什么是一个很重要的对吧？所以说说有时候我说你刚才讲的那那怎么了？
很重要吗？
就我意思是这个这个title变了吗？就重要吗？为什么重要？会影响什么呢？
一定要下下一个啊等一下你们讲什么医疗企业？
那你说又开始影响这个生活？只是就像你这个影响理想家庭关系，那这个对，但是，哦，不好意思，我再说另外一点了，但是我们就是OB啊，你这个结果还是还是要回到那个商学院的一些那个这里，不能说那个下一代，你也不能说那个驾驶关系会不会影响员工的表现，会不会影响团队的合作，会会影响什么，怎么又是员工，请你加上员工，员工请假就少了。
你觉得这个就你意思是一点道理，那个external，我根本也介绍那个external对吧？会反而导致请假少是吧？
就是说是因为他不会把你家的事情他不在我的生死，所以爸妈生病了就说没什么事儿啊，他会。
可能不会，他不会那么因为他或者说影响员工积极性，虽然更积极，还是就是。
腾而戈了是不会会减少，但是会。
亲人生病而。
不是就是因为他是就是有可能有吃的。就比如说就为什么说这个北角可以在对吧？你说现在这个low cost control可能变化对吧？基本都是大家都是比较强调这个internal对吧？这个资质性比较强对吧？或者说是那个self ethics比较强，现在可能是反倒是比较低，但是就会到这个interesting point，如果说self advocacy D它的表现不好对吧？就感觉比较废话对吧，那时候不不喜欢。
Excellent external external control of control会导致，但是请假小了会提高这个working time，对吧？唉，这是counterintuitive让他说，为什么你说你逻辑解释对吧？因为其实很多这些事情，我说管理家的事儿，这样我不管我啥都不管，反正我们就要好好工作，唉，这个挺有意思的，而且如果你可以去公司收一些数据，真的把它拿去看，你看那时候无所谓的员工，反正不请假。
唉，不是我说你是肯定发不了啊，真的不是。如果你说我发现无所谓的，不管那个人那是稳定的，他啥时候都能操心啊，对吧？那这不应该。这是一个something new right it's also important，那就是以后你找人，你不要说你这边是不是很积极，我要问你是不是不是别的事都不管是吗？他是三省的，不能问这些问题，我问一下别的问题啊。
就。其实这是一个conversation，你出去你出个点，所以我们这。其实我这个时候别的题啊就是跑题啊，但是还没有中国学生就是读博士啊，就是人生他那个问题是，但是不敢说这些那个crazy ideas你见过，当时为什么你们都不举手啊，你们是不是你知道吗？你举手不定的前提有帮助啊，你不知道学习吗？那你知道的话为什么不做这个行为啊，但是你怕别人看到你在这边说话说的不对啊，或者这边是。
哎呀，说的观念不有错误的。don't worry在我们这个领域上，顶多是你说的这东西错那个研究结果不符合政府不支持。
那没关系啊，那就这些最严重明明出别的idea了，但是你敢说这个idea那出这些就country truly的一些想法，这个才能出一些有趣的这些突破性的想法，所以这很好的很好的，而且别想了，就是说这个没准成成立的，而且如果你可以从时间这么一件事情，那你看谁笑话对吧，就是你说你厉害你们就你们就就没想到啊对吧？所以说你要赶上要risk hiking对吧？
I think often people's risk taking is too low but conscientiousness太高了，你们太认真了，太乖呀，这不好啊，你要敢说敢闯啊，对吧？没准儿可以才真正做出一些新的研究。so that's why a lot of times with theory we're not looking for people who are very good students who have crazy ideas for creative，就这很好很好，而且说别的地方就是说就是这些想法，你就是通过一些不同年代啊，就是不同的那个。
对吧？可以找到一些新的想法，敢说敢想才能出去新的那个价值。sorry I know it's a little bit little bit on the topic，I think it's very interesting idea。如果感兴趣的话呢，以后也可以说出这样的试试。
Now，this is Maybe in America，right？a matter of these applied to China who are talking about other different values in like American for different ages generations，right？so，for instance，if you look at like Maybe a grandparents they'll have a hard work，loyalty，you know Joe responsibility or something now we're much more about multiculturalism creativity innovation so over time，that means that values not just for people，right，but also as a whole generation will change。
So this if I use a stable，but Maybe stable over a few years，not stable Forever。
Now once again，it's kind of same risks of we talk about personality right don't you stereotype we're。
年轻人怎么怎么了？I think Maybe you guys are less likely to do this we're good at your parents，right？or you can get employers。现在年轻人都说什么对吧？
So Maybe you don't worry so much，right？
What's generation and what's my stage，you know，it's just two hundred dollars周边累了或者是不是那波人就是懒意思这个意思。so these are things considered，but also，you know you're thinking about for you Maybe you'll not be likely to pigeonhole as much or we'll talk with，you know your parents，your boss right then那边那些缴费啊，怎么沟通啊，看看需要注意一下，那这个可能不用跟你说对吧？那个家长说话可能是一些观点可能就不提吧，对吧？
说话语气呀，一些东西他就就符合他们的一些习惯，是吧？
So this is honestly you should know this right if you don't know this then Maybe be telling you this will not help you because if you want就是你到现在还没意识到这个价值观的重要性。我讲这些课也可能现在说也没有especially whenever people across generations because right now even as you're a teacher right I'm quite young I'm not illusions那个老板对吧？
But when you work at a company，Maybe your boss is much ordering。so how do you talk to people from a different generation？it's very important。
然后你也变老了以后你跟年轻人说有什么味道？so，this is my thing very the most important part of the of personality，right，this is about the person in the environment to talk to a fit，right？so person Jonathan is the first time I fit we're going to talk about and we just have a personality by itself Maybe it's a bit boring and asking you are kind of tired right before we talk about spit就是人和这个环境的匹配。
就匹配是不一样的时候，就是两个东西，一个是人，一个是environment。所以这样的话可以有很多组合，所以think about this，right，you know personality is like a quick thing，right？你就是这么多。so you can just choose these，right？but if you have personality and then you're environment it becomes nice it becomes a multiplication right？
So in this way，because multiplication you can have many different outcomes and this allows you to make many interesting conversations now Darren这个问题是在哪儿什么？
Because of arrangement outcomes of personality and environment right？you need to explain why this is important。就比如说我说那个炎症对吧？就说外向的那个领导可能是对这些自主性强的团队都影响不错。so first of all外星人领导是不是很重要的？yes it's important personality to talk about right and then she was high self efficacies also Maybe an important context right，but If I Say is a Machiavellian leader。
Good for a team of sensing people right？那个可能是奇怪Maybe it doesn't it's a weird combination so the promising to choose a good story，right？a good personality and a good environmental fit就是说讲故事的要这个要make sense。
But a lot of tummy immunity stories so first time we talk about is person job，就是说你这个岗位是不是你这个人，你是不是当老师啊？你是不是当教学员啊？那上面就拿了个mbti，right it's very important that's why everybody reads that part of the survey right what job recommendation you have。
So this is quite obvious that I put some of the key perspectives demands of dilities so basically one of the job demands you're，公司需要什么？没有什么能力那另外是needs supplies，所以这个面试工作是用什么你不不符合这个要求啊，就是demand不对，那可以是综合税对吧？就是销售就是那个市场需要什么，你能不能给他够对吧？然后另外是need supplies就是你这个人。
是从我在吃的时候是一个岗位就是。而且人家接着说这儿是从这儿切的，那最后我还是给interaction这个明白吗？嗯，就是个交叉。
Now we just have a job表示你岗位。another thing is organization你是不是这个公司？
So this question is more not just you，but for the whole organization，you know，are you adding two hundred people to the same kind of people，right？people with different qualities我们需不需要这些不同的那个性格还是这个一致性啊。do you want to have same values goals。
This again is quite similar，------------ ------------ key difference between job and organization is job is about job specific task。那这个任务你这个做事情对吧？那怎么办这个公司文化，这些公司的价值观。so it's not simply about your job it's more about overall the whole company，但是商家逻辑也差不多，嗯。
Another important question，it goes back to nature verse nurture，right？你记得吗？你是天生别人是不是被培养出来？那这个理由是类似的，我们要不要聘一个合适的人，还是我们要培养一个合适的人，你觉得呢？
对批判情况。
谁说屁还是谁说是你这个老板对吧？开始可以批了，后来可以慢慢的，嗯组织做大做强，这个意思就是这是一个问题吧，你能不能筛选是吧？can you effectively select right，can you identify培养员工也是一种员工激励的这种正规游戏对。
So for socialization，right？how you个问题跟你说，那假如说如果是培养一个，比如说我现在投网对吧？they，send a lot of money in time training us because we have like the Happier training，we have a lot of classes。
然后培养我们做的好我们去干嘛？
跳跳槽啊，跳槽就说基金里吧，嗯，所以那个值不值得培养？right？那你说screening right？那screening也是有成本的，然后就说这个没有你说我要上理想的人，这个能找到你会多少个人，那你是Google对吧？你是微软是吗？就是那个阿里，那你可以screen为小公司你也没有这个number HR Department，how do you do screening so Maybe you know there's advantages，right？if you select somebody，you give me a fit，but also another problem too。
一旋转是不是合适的？
University is the benefits of having people even knock the Perfect exactly the same right？Maybe it's good to go a little bit different and we can raise them to be we could count on比较符合的人，但是不会说是一出生就是都一样的it's time consuming and also，我是把你改变，我是改变你变成了人。doesn't make you happy you know I say，you know，thank you for coming but you have some problems so I'm gonna make you you're a better worker Maybe you don't want to be trained。
Tree is OK，right？remember socialization especially for values，right？因为现在很多公司很多团建其实团建是一个socialization，我们是给你就是就是洗脑的嘛那个。
然后那个什么BAT，对吧？那些科技公司周周六啊，你肯定是你现在是周六吗？应该不是吧，但是以后到那个到那个阿里的吧，那是不是该那个把你这个socialize把你变成了蜘蛛的那个科技园对吧？you want that被弄成好不好？so this is a kind of a cool question，you know how to go about really fit you to the drive，choose the right person you fit or do I make you fit？
So kind of to go over and cover a lot of stuff today，right？but we talk about some key points or the personalities pretty much stable and it's most stable thing and we have these different ways of measures in this big five MBTI，------------ \----\----\----\----\---- are some issues，right？you know，if we say this person is a fixed person who's accept that also could use that to select people is a biasing and stereotyping。
Now at the war variable which is跟那个状态的is values it's still very stable but it's something that's more based on nurture not just nature，we are with different values of best cultures there was one generations and it will affect how we act with people and how we actually and the fact that I think a lot of the research for this company is more in the fit perspective right if we still if we assume that these stable treats are really hard to change，right？
差不多了吧？
Change people a little bit right？you fit the job better。it is an important question that we think about。
So let's think about truth is，I talked about last class about the boundaries，right？
就是边界for cultures，we think about Chinese culture，American culture，especially when you're working at global organization you know how these different cultures how do they affect our values how different personalities and also are there any benefits of being more sensitive right？we talk about the self monitoring self monitoring how we draft so I know it's kind of a lot but we're talking about selection team leadership organization it's very important for many different things。
And。well，I think we all understand personality quite well。it's quite easy，but it's also a very important kind of Foundation，so once again，I don't do personally research myself，but something to know and understand。
Now，I love a lot of times I know last time I had a lot of questions about this，right？so this is we're talking about the group project。
So this is something that's very important，right to kind of important is one is the new part is okay？so today we talked about personnel I'll send this in a group chat right。
这两个心理心理舒服。
A group project，right？this is not homework，这不是作业啊。look，it's not it's due before next one next homework is three，twenty six就是这月底啊。this is not hard。你不做的事情不理想OK this is optional right if you want to choose your own good？
You can choose your own good明白吗？你要说你感觉对呀，你可以自己选择。
But only four to five people say if you don't choose your creation。
Then I will choose a group for you。
So you know。
我是随机的，如果是半米半随机会做那个S。
个比方说呢，随机动物儿，你说我说完全完美but you want to you could choose your group OK，嗯，第一次那我是就email me a list of the names in your ID at the uniforms OK，this way，I will not put you in another group OK。
As our sign the people of ours now I think important thing as I mentioned right，is that I want to make things fair。so I'm not going to tell you the specific group project that's live details until three twenty six so I will assign the groups on the same day that I give you the specific details of the project otherwise the groups that decide earlier we're having an advantage we usually start work earlier and I know I'm hearing no complaints。
哎呀，他们开始没有早上nobody knows this assignment until three twenty six OK，not that's it right it's more about其实我已经讲过，大家也没有知道but I'll give this specific Simon in class something else too。so now the class population是来上这个应该是稳定的对吧？嗯，so my Chinese is not very good and I was thinking we can Maybe introduce ourselves ------------ there's a lot of people in the class，right？
So I care a lot of class participation I think it's very important，but if I don't know your name I don't know who you are，Maybe it's harder for me to analyze that and I don't want to ask each person so if you can。
If you don't mind Maybe send me like one page or like you're，basically your name，your name in English，right？if you have English name in a Picture Of You。
No more pictures No more。就是那个什么你头像手持身份证可以啊。
Wechat games，right and you Wechat pictures，most of you don't have。
所以我也不好意思肯定是这个人对吧？also，签到我也不知道是谁呀。so I know your face is right，but I want to learn your names too，and my Chinese is not so good and Maybe you have very complicated names like I can't read the characters you know my name is very easy hope you should go ten，我学过我也学过，但是那些你们那个名字太复杂那个。
So if you have a English and it's helpful too，you know be appalled here。
如果没有做女性没关系I know you're facing so I say idea there I send you your name and your face。如果有什么interesting可以把没关系啊。basically so I do participation I can remember correctly who's participating，然后包括那个whoa的我跟你说我这次为啥还是很重要的啊。because hope you know，learn but also as you know，American style，classroom，this type of testing like we don't have the push on。
主观没那么没那么adjust有没有期末考试？right，so we have paper，right，so class participation。
Final homework is an individual paper，right？but participation is imported and help it understand your thinking。so it is important to participate in class so please if you don't mind then once again，你不怕我也没关系啊。如果你发我的话，我会加上音响，如果increase the。
I know who's participating。
Right，so send me a group that's an option。sending your email back to an option，right？but就是大家这些。这些内容。
So any question about the group project group teams？
No questions。so for the rest of the class，right？我知道现在那个是不是有点儿就是现在有点儿早，所以我还有点儿时间。然后刚开始聊一下，是这个phenomenon right，所以今天这个是this is outside personality let's go back about the homework。so I left some time to talk about the homework and why it's important to think about this，right？so the homework I ask you to identify an organization have a problem？
So，for instance，one of the homeworks are right was about actually。
I didn't research for a leading technology company in China that is public company and that's education。你可以知道这个公司这个上市公司，国外上市公司。so they had strong effect of double reduction and it affected their employees。now I saw the right person who wrote an article wrote the。
Review，right talking about how many effects the way employees think and they act right and I think it's important before we move forward，right？so what is that was II really like that piece，right it identified a courage topic，right，you talk about how currently，you know an important thing for China and for companies is you know shown here it's a现在的问题，right it's a new time policy that effective organizations。
But I also know some people ask me questions，这是不是只能做一些公司层面的right in that paper，they spoke about how double reduction as a phenomenon就是这个线上可能是发生在一个。
双节对吧？它是发生在一个比较宏观的角度而已，就是第一次宏观的角度right backroom but we talk about how this is affecting the people right就是还是那是个微观的。
OK employee behavior主要是要地址，是不是那个情绪类似这样的事情，right，so a lot of times if you want to talk a new phenomenon it might be a macro trend。比如说我们说AI对吧？AI workforce，但是我看是这个背景，它是宏观的，但是落到公司，我看是，比如说很多企业还是智能体验对吧？然后再配置这些是员工，那这会导致员工的这些什么行为，是不是会影响他们那个内在动力啊。
So I got some questions about this。I think it was important is so we're talking about phenomenon we're talking about organizations oftentimes？it started very big level right？and then that helps us Get Down to a smaller level identify a only problem，so on one hand，right就是最宏观的让国家政策对吧？少年国家说现在比如说ESG right talk about how the world is in warmer this pollution right？这是非常宏观的。
那as a result，那就开始做通过微观的这个say as a result employees care more and more about the company's business practices，Joshua don't grant on the organization the first organization fit。what do you think personality has motivation？so we said they care about organization person right as a result that will affect their behavior are they willing to work hard，right？will affect their performance。
So oftentimes when we're doing the backward we're going to join a video说宏观到微观，如果插管的process，我不是说为什么会导致这个process right？你不要说哦，现在就是这个world game warmer，right，so people care about。
You know，ESG and that will make them work harder，Maybe，Maybe，right，but you just explain how caring about ESG makes them more harder，and just doing the logic这个逻辑，right？so the background is going to be going from macro to micro right when the logic that you're arguing is第二个模块，对吧？可能是微观中的微观，就比如说。
Instant you might talk about，you know，once again，ESG people came a little more about ESG so that'll affect，so people come back，ESG right？and that will affect。how teens work together就是团队课程，还是要注意一下，这是DER不叫DEI吗？这个知道吧，这是那个diversity。
多元多的话，就是衡量那个机子的中国牛--------就是那个意思，就是衡量你的就是你必须得做一些这个多元化的，就这个会导致team structure对吧？然后为什么会因为team structure更好还是更差对吧？so。
When we talk about when we do homeworks right it's okay to start from a big from macro level and then use that to Get Down to the micro level right now。that's very helpful，but just in order to Keep，should you try to think more of the micro level，right？our people how groups are driving。
Is because it's important for your final homework，right？or for your group project。if you're going to talk about a phenomenon and you're going to think about you know how to solve it。
The story，right？the background is Mac or the micro，------------ ------------ process right包括怎么办？应该是微观的是，假如是，如果你说。
大家都是在意这个ESG，所以导致大家这个这个公平对吧？是不是要公平，所以我们在这个第二这个多元性的这个啊团队那怎么办？我们现在从hiring practice做一些调整，或者team structure，我们应该是就说我们也是多个维度的那个多样性，而不仅是那个光是那个race对吧这个意思，但是如果你说是我的办法是这个宏观维度我们应该是。
有更多的那个欢迎难民来，然后就可以提高我们的社会的那个比例啊。it's a little bit strange，OK，right，你目前还没出那个how to solve the problem，right，你记得吗？就是说你们是刚才作业，我没有要求你出这几个方案，就是在说的时候以后就一般来说是我们是从宏观到微观对吧？但是我们解决方案也是在同一个层面，所以就是说如果说那个社会变暖，我不能说是我们要。
减少这个工业化，这不是一个微观的答案。你说我作为我作为team leader，我也我也无法治理这个，这个去看。所以一般来说五个小宏观到微观，我们讲故事对吧？但是我们这个过程，然后我的这个解决办法应该是到时候考空的范围内，我这个管理层，我对员工我应该怎么办？我对团队的队员，对吧？
So the important part is I said you guys did a very good job，you know，thinking about these problems right then actually think about solutions identifying things we all need to Keep up more at the micro level，change of微观的层面来思考东西。现在这个大家明白吗？还是没有什么问题吗？这个是比较抽象的。do you understand？嗯，大家OK吗？
No question。OK，so then。
If there anything else。
应该还行吧，今天因为今天你们都不要睡了，没想到没有快question是吧，所以that's kind of overview for the homework。also，if you think you had any issues with the homework or you have any questions，you know，feel free to contact。and yeah，I think it's a good job，everybody trying to work on time，so这里可能稍微接触稍微早点，然后那个如果没有别的问题，可能就差不多就这样。
好好嗯。
没问题吗？就是说关于那个homework关于上个homework，关于这个homework这个这个这种。
Work on their on the twenty sixth this one the homework is assigned，I think。
Personnel哎，这个问题好了你这样分享有用吗？
可能不大，学习不好，我招人的时候也不用看这个我们不会说，还是感觉现在现在学习的这些personality，怎么说呢，就是你用的时候浪漫感觉其实是不用特别去就是那种就是就是。
我觉得我就这是我自己的认为。my my personal opinion right首先不是在批量unbiased，right，I do think data，I do AR list that's very applied就是比较应用性比较强对吧？也是很明显的，你确实用过，你说当时有用吗？就是就大家不谈这事情person，I think question right，so I said I'm very biased I think because I don't do personality research。
这是麦片but I feel that very personality is if you go to use it it's gonna be risky right？你说我可以用它来做。
You know hire people，right？
Maybe not as much use，but if you can find do not pronounce other unlike leadership。so what type of leadership？and if you choose this type of weird it，what type of personality of people you should？hire or help you the project。so with that right，I think person is useful for understanding your trump，right？which is what consistent？
吧，这个可以逃得出来but if you say这个人要不要骗他？if you say it's Instrumental tool就是你要应用它作为SHR manager，right purchase manager，we're as a person，你自己你的性格，你相信这个性格怎么样，你感觉你性格什么也不是这样的人对吧？我本身话多，我就这样的，我整个看的是我控制一下那个情绪啊，类似这样的事情我自己可能要大方一点，什么这样的事情。
个体怎么办啊？没必要做what you can do so I think Maybe personalized for useful as an exponential tool。但是说你更理解这件事情可能确实要去解释，但是practical tool那个I think it's limited because it uses，you know，in practice有问题。
嗯，那你觉得你们最性格，比如说我问你个问题啊when you do teamwork，right，what you think of personality。就是比如说有一些新加坡人学习好啊，而且是性格好，学习不好的人就是地方各。so your performance history，right就是业绩表现和那个性格，你觉得哪个更重要作为听我的。
听我。
Kpi重要，你没有还选择一个新的号的人这是所谓的，这是一个匹配的。
还是会看那个KPI？
我可以去匹配。
但是你们不是刚说嘛，你不是跟那个两个例子吗？一个是长的是学霸，就是就是说不是，不是说那个一个人性格怎么样，而是说如果有两个性格不相容的人会怎么样，就如果有一个人的性格特别不好的话，我们可以去符合他的预期。
自己想你有多长时间就是小时候，比如说今天你们回去可以发一下那个小组那个名单对吧？说你要说那些你认为我也比较好合作的就是比较匹配啊，就比较要好好工作，而且是那些学习最强的人。
因为当时我刚才问你啊，你说那学霸组啊，才学那个东西好的那些组啊，因为都没有那个学霸组啊。但是那个学霸有同事说他们比较考试嘛啊，不是说那个学霸组比较考试的，自己就是内向学霸。
那你们什么都啥外甥女儿吗？但是您这个地方说的是这个一个性格很不好的学霸啊。嗯，那如果是离学校都很好的obviously心里又好玩，又是学霸，那肯定是你也选那个，你最好你知道吧，年纪好你也培养好，这肯定选对吧？那假如说因为很难做一个理想的，往往是就是学习最好的人，他们有一些初恋眼睛吧，嗯，所以那样的话你会喜欢吃哪一个，就是今天比如说要考虑跟谁就那么问一下directions people that you get along。
这个好像学习不错，那如果你们都选择学习不错的，那你看谁比较成熟啊，是不是赶紧去约他？那个就是就是办法定一下那些勺子啊，你说他说will you choose somebody who thinks比较好，还是choose，这是绝对的，这就是那个业绩表现比较好，这不是我选的一个问题是谁愿意接纳我的问题，双向选择。
你们就研究啊，开始有各方面的因素对吧？你说我现在想要选一个队员了，那我不能说是这个屋里头，我就随便指一个吧，我得至少认识他才能选的吧。对呀，就是确实你看谁好像要努力，是我们比较熟悉啊，但是谁比较好说话，你们选择谁啊，这不用说了。
这块钱，那宝贝有个支持啊。better performer or a better personnel，嗯，那你说。
这个。这个想要一个例子就是上个学期我上了那个课，然后课呢是星座丰富。
我什么就好吧，好什么就好吧。
为了避免还是太先进，老师的解释呢，是为了避免free rider，但是其实就做下来发现就是。
的确哈，这个某一些星座都对的确有一些特质。
很有趣的意思就是心理暗示。你刚才老师说会了就这是X和y，对吧？XY，这都是为了你的XY what is XX是什么星座类型星座类型星座甚至会导致那个decrease freewider yeah。你不知道这个逻辑我还是不太明白对吧？就是说为什么说这个解释你必须把逻辑先选对吧？
星座分组会导致这星座分组啊，会导致lower free rider这个这个过程是怎么？这是什么？
奖啊，不是这个过程中怎么发出的？
星座分组，大家互不认识都不好意思当free rider啊，那我这谁去那么久啊，就就是新课程随机分类新闻都有随机分的方式，就是本质上还是随机分的。但是这个老师显然认为星座不影响性格，但是这个视频讲的是一个强假设，你说是心动分组是相当于随机分组啊，但是对吧？那他可能认为星座跟学习分组是怎么样，但实际可能并不是这样，那那这还有一个问题，如果是。
分组，但是随机分组是等价的。那为什么只居然随机分组啊？是觉得是。
性格匹配一点可能觉得同一个星座的人大家性格差不多，然后所以这样子，所以他那个不是随机，那这个逻辑不一样的，你就说这个，那这个不是随机的，你说这个过程为什么？他说是因为是随机，你说的是因为是匹配度高啊对吧？因为我也是那个课，我们也是课本。
是不一样的如果说是那么大家随机的，对吧？
随机的过程那那为什么谁是随机啊？那如果是不是随机的，就可能会提高性格匹配度啊。很多快递，那你说讲他怎么提高这个过程的话，因为这个你说新的分组会提高，所以没读完，但是这个题只要匹配度的过程，你需要长开是吧？
那就是我这挺有意思的那个那你说感觉有一些性格不一样的是吧？性格不一样，就是他没有遵循，就是很幸福。这方面他最后分组的依依据呢是凑数。
有有两个，然后天上之内分明白明白，八个加起来刚好是十个哦。所以说把你都按照平均的课堂里面，但是还有另外一个好像有16块钱，所以刚才就是你说是那个确实感觉不一样对吧？就是星座，比如你没有，那还有另外一个问题，就会那个培训的后面如果我说我是按照星座给你分组啊，那是不是你会按照你星座的这个表现。
会多出这个就是usually self fulfilling就心理暗示对，就是说对你是这个人对吧，我就跟你说我给你定位你是什么性格对吧？所以你就按照你的表现，这也是一个问题啊。就比如说我们当时来一次聊，你是不是考成绩呢？你就发现那个你考那个性性格可能不是最理想的对吧？你是不是努力改啊，能调整啊，这些星座会努力调整星座，那开玩笑，这就是说做个实验验证一下，哎，你可以走，但我自己不注意观点，你。
你说星座不知道还有个问题啊，那你说我发现星座确实星座一样，那个星座肯定就会提高。
但是这个国家这个你记得当天是掌握问题啊。it's interesting，Maybe it's interesting，right？but is it important，is it？rather，is it useful to learn English？
你说我发现星座会导致团队的那个提高效率啊，因为大家体育提高，那时候就回到是不是不如直接做一个进口测试，就按照性格就没意思了。对呀，有道理，看到想的就是说说，你说这个事情哪怕是有趣的，你必须回到说这有什么用啊？对公司来说毕竟是商学院的对吧？然后还是回到这个application。
反正你是不是问题没关系，我的问题是什么？你要学的那些学霸，还有学的性格好的人，你们还没想好对吧？按照你们说的那个星座好像是星座好星座匹配度高啊，可能还是比较有用是吧。
So it's an important question。你刚才讲的是what is the team right，you know，team is people and the people in the team，right？so what is the team it's a team the sum of the individuals in particular加在一起，他是不是你们之间的互动啊，对吧？
So what you're saying is Maybe it's the whole team is more important as the individual right individual differences，so Maybe What's more important is不是看每个人的性格的匹配，然后合作。
所有去CPU，这个我们EDOA and。
你上一次，我记得你上一次的时候是你说那个上一个学期的工作方式招聘就是或者这个工作室一个人所有工作对吧？然后查的是free write，那这样的情况下不会查别人来看一下啊。but you see individual differences right and then team level differences it's quite complicated，然后我们之后我们要选择team，你可以想一想，就是what is driving success，right what's going to make you successful team是那个性格匹配。
而且是不是绝对绝对你比如说IQ啊这些东西啊，那你可以思考一下你喜欢的一些team member，那当然这个双双双那个more cross direction那个选择对吧？but your goal is叫the best great possible，那你可以想一想那个什么team will give you the best results，而且可以用buy邮件要报一下这样的一个team。
嗯，那你们会你们那边已经有听到了吗？有想法吗？还在想吗？嗯。
有信吗？喂，北京吧。嗯，不是至少整了，唉哦，对，这是个环境，if you don't mind，这个什么安全up to you right，如果你愿意的话，你可以告诉我，你那时候发现那个邮件，你给我是个team对吧？你可以跟我说，how did you choose your team，你可以给我讲讲这个过程就why do I choose why do we how do we choose these numbers。
但是这是自愿的你不用说对吧？那你可以跟我讲比如说坐旁边的人。
就是说做朋友就是带一勺子，然后我们是老朋友啊。而且我看谁不知道at least we是努力啥的before this。
如果你愿意啊，你可以给我，你可以给我写一句话就说你是怎么这些勺子是怎么出来的，就是作为我兴趣爱好就是curious我就感兴趣而已，那大家可以right，but you can think about how you made this tea，it's interesting too。好，那就到这儿了吧。然后有什么问题啊，那就随时沟通了。好快，谢谢啊。
