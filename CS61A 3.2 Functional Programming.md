In this section, we introduce a high-level programming language that encourages a functional style. Our object of study, a subset of the Scheme language, employs a very similar model of computation to Python's, **but uses only expressions** (no statements), specializes in symbolic computation, and employs only immutable values.

Scheme programs consist of expressions, which are either call expressions or special forms. A call expression consists of an operator expression followed by zero or more operand sub-expressions, as in Python.
Scheme exclusively uses prefix notation.

As in Python, Scheme expressions may be primitives or combinations. Number literals are primitives, while call expressions are combined forms that include arbitrary sub-expressions. *The evaluation procedure* of call expressions matches that of Python: first the operator and operand expressions are evaluated, and then the function that is the value of the operator is applied to the arguments that are the values of the operands.

<span style="background:#d3f8b6">The if expression</span> in Scheme is a _special form_, meaning that while it looks syntactically like a call expression, it has a different evaluation procedure. The general form of an if expression is:`if <predicate> <consequent> <alternative>`.

<span style="background:#d3f8b6">Numerical values</span> can be compared using familiar comparison operators, but prefix notation is used in this case as well:
```
(>= 2 1)
true
```

The boolean values #t (or true) and #f (or false) in Scheme can be combined with boolean special forms, which have evaluation procedures similar to those in Python.

> - (and \<e1> ... \<en>) The interpreter evaluates the expressions \<e> one at a time, in left-to-right order. If any \<e> evaluates to false, the value of the and expression is false, and the rest of the \<e>'s are not evaluated. If all \<e>'s evaluate to true values, the value of the and expression is the value of the last one.
> - (or \<e1> ... \<en>) The interpreter evaluates the expressions \<e> one at a time, in left-to-right order. If any \<e> evaluates to a true value, that value is returned as the value of the or expression, and the rest of the \<e>'s are not evaluated. If all \<e>'s evaluate to false, the value of the or expression is false.
> - (not \<e>) The value of a not expression is true when the expression \<e> evaluates to false, and false otherwise.

### 3.2.2   Definitions
The general form of a procedure definition is:
```
(define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)
```

User-defined functions can take multiple arguments and include special forms:
```
(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))
(average 1 3)
2
(define (abs x)
    (if (< x 0)
        (- x)
        x))
(abs -3)
3
```

Scheme supports *local definitions* with the same lexical scoping rules as Python.

### 3.2.3   Compound values

*Pairs* are built into the Scheme language. For historical reasons, pairs are created with the `cons` built-in function, and the elements of a pair are accessed with `car` and `cdr`

Recursive lists are also built into the language, using pairs. A special value denoted <span style="background:#d3f8b6">nil</span> or `'()` represents the empty list. A recursive list value is rendered by placing its elements within parentheses, separated by spaces:
```
(cons 1
      (cons 2
            (cons 3
                  (cons 4 nil))))

(cons 10 one-through-four)
(10 1 2 3 4)
(cons 5 one-through-four)
(5 1 2 3 4)
```

Whether a list is empty can be determined using the primitive <span style="background:#d3f8b6">null?</span> predicate. Using it, we can define the standard sequence operations for computing <span style="background:#d3f8b6">length</span> and selecting elements:

### 3.2.4   Symbolic Data

All the compound data objects we have used so far were constructed ultimately from numbers. One of Scheme's strengths is <span style="background:#d3f8b6">working with arbitrary symbols as data</span>.

In order to manipulate symbols we need a new element in our language: the ability to _quote_ a data object. Suppose we want to construct the list `(a b)`. We can't accomplish this with `(list a b)`, because this expression constructs a list <span style="background:#d3f8b6">of the values of a and b</span> rather than the symbols themselves. In Scheme, we refer to the symbols a and b rather than their values by preceding them with <span style="background:#d3f8b6">a single quotation mark</span>:

```
(list a b)
(1 2)
(list 'a 'b)
(a b)
(list 'a b)
(a 2)
```

In Scheme, any expression that is not evaluated is said to be _quoted_.
