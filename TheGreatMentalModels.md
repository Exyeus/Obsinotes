Map is not equivalent to the *real field*. Maps, to some extent, represent models that try to simplify, emulate and predict this world.
The benefits are significant, but the drawbacks should never be ignored: 
	1. There are always details that maps cannot include;
	2. The facts in maps may be outdated;
	3. Persons who create maps, may be dominated by their subjective ideas.
What we should learn from these facts, is that we should always think of something out of our accordance when we are deciding on something. Our thinking must go beyond existing maps.

*The capablity circle*.
capablity circle should certainly be expanded, if this operation conforms to the maximization of our comprehensive growth.
However, when doing things we must make sure that we are working on things included in our circle.
A person has no knowledge for stocks can play an significant role in managing a company, as long as he does not join manipulating stocks.

*The first-order principle*
Think of things at the most basic principles, instead of some unreliable facts. We often regard some opinions that are often mentioned by peoples as unchangeable truths, and refuse to modify it when we desire of an improvement on ourself by ameliorating all aspects.
Actually, it is the basic facts from different subjects that serve as the blocks that construct all the things.
With these 'blocks' resolved from the superfluous things, we then go back to reconstruct the object we desire to improve, with reachable optimization all along the steps.

*Idea Experiment*
*A quite new topic for me*. I've notice some announcements that can be classified into this.
For me, partial differentiation in *multivariable calculus* is a analogy that firstly occurred in my mind. We set something into perfect state, for the variable we concern, to be observed in a well-developed environment, so as to test out some facts that is quite hard to discover within ordinary events in our daily life. Beside of the electronic train dilemma mentioned in the book, I also notice that a common type of questions that often appear in *Zhihu*, might also represent this: *If something was given to Zhuge Liang, would he successfully defect Northern Wei Dynasty*. If enough data given, I can train an AI model to depict a person's traits based on his answer to this question.

*Second Order Thinking*

We can introduce first order thinking first. We only desire a result, and we only think of possible ways to reach this.
However, *second order thinking* further instruct us to think of the results of the results. 
The extinction of a kind of animal may destruct other kinds of species along the food chain, and a policy rewards residents based on dead snakes may not lead to the deaths of *wild* snakes, but the rise of raising snakes with commercial propose.
What we can learn from this, is to always consider of complex relationships when we try to approach things. A way towards a trophy may be full of traps.

*Thinking with Probablity Views*.

Some facts from probablity theory is quite worthy of concerning.
Often our intuition betrays us when we think about some facts related to probablity.
In fact, from my point of view, to think this way, we can *borrow some skills from First-Order Principles*:
1. For the object we take interst in, what probability facts may be correlated to it most?
2. Find the facts. What are their basic ingredients? What real life things are these ingredients corresponding to?
3. Research onto these factors.

The dependence property of events also provides us with a method, to estimate the accuracy for our decision:
One's choice made when he is the first to choose, is more persuasive than one's choice done with not being the first, when some options are not available. From this view, choices that happen later, are partly determined by previous selection made by other people. In other word, *dependent*.

*Reverse Thinking*
Thinking from the result we desire.
Often used in math proofs.
Instead of thinking about ways to make money, think about ways to reduce consumption.

*Occam's Razor*

To deploy entities as less as possible, to explain things.
==I think this has some contradiction with the model-related theory, or something need to be considered when using this principle==: Fewer variables in emulating a system, may lead to less accuracy. That is similar to approximations for function. How many orders of derivatives we should compute to approximately analyze the function, depends on the *value of variables given*.

*Hanlon's Razor Law*

Things can be interpreted as stupidity, should not be further interpreted as spite. *I think this is more of a way to stablize our mood*.
