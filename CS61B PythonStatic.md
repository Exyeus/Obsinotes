Okay, let's break down the concepts equivalent to "static" and "non-static" members in Python. While Python doesn't use the `static` keyword in the exact same way as Java, it has distinct ways to define members that belong either to the *class itself* (like static) or to *individual instances* of the class (non-static).

Here's the breakdown:

**1. Non-Static (Instance) Members**

These are the most common type of members in Python classes. They <font color="#ffff00">belong to specific objects (instances) created from the class</font>. Each object gets its own copy of instance attributes, and instance methods operate on the data of the specific object they are called on.

*   **Instance Attributes:**
    *   **Definition:** Usually defined within the `__init__` method (the constructor) using `self.attribute_name = value`.
    *   **Ownership:** Each *instance* of the class has its *own separate copy* of these attributes. Changes to `obj1.attribute` do not affect `obj2.attribute`.
    *   **Access:** Accessed through an instance of the class (e.g., `my_object.attribute_name`).

*   **Instance Methods:**
    *   **Definition:** Regular methods defined within the class that take `self` <font color="#ffff00">as their first parameter</font>. `self` refers to the specific instance the method is called on.
    *   **Purpose:** Operate on or use the instance attributes (`self.attribute_name`) or call other instance methods (`self.other_method()`).
    *   **Access:** Called on an instance (e.g., `my_object.method_name()`).

**Example:**

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        # Instance attributes: Each dog has its own name and breed
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.tricks = [] # Each dog has its own list of tricks

    # Instance method: Operates on the specific dog instance (self)
    def add_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)
        print(f"{self.name} learned {trick}!")

    # Instance method: Accesses instance attributes
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

# Create instances (objects)
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
dog2 = Dog("Lucy", "Poodle")

# Access instance attributes (each dog has its own)
print(f"{dog1.name} is a {dog1.breed}") # Output: Buddy is a Golden Retriever
print(f"{dog2.name} is a {dog2.breed}") # Output: Lucy is a Poodle

# Call instance methods (operate on specific instances)
dog1.add_trick("fetch") # Buddy learned fetch!
dog2.add_trick("roll over") # Lucy learned roll over!

print(f"Buddy's tricks: {dog1.tricks}") # Output: Buddy's tricks: ['fetch']
print(f"Lucy's tricks: {dog2.tricks}") # Output: Lucy's tricks: ['roll over']

dog1.speak() # Output: Buddy says Woof!
dog2.speak() # Output: Lucy says Woof!
```

**2. Static-like (Class Level) Members**

These members belong to the *class itself*, not to any specific instance. They are shared <font color="#ffff00">among all instances of the class</font>.

*   **Class Attributes:**
    *   **Definition:** Defined directly within the class body, *outside* of any method (including `__init__`).
    *   **Ownership:** There is only *one copy* of <font color="#ffff00">a class attribute</font>, shared by *all instances* of the class and the class itself.
    *   **Access:** Can be accessed through the class name (`ClassName.attribute_name`) or through an instance (`instance.attribute_name`). **Caution:** If you assign a value to `instance.class_attribute`, you actually create a *new instance attribute* with the same name that shadows the class attribute for that specific instance. Modifying via the class name (`ClassName.attribute_name = new_value`) affects all instances that haven't shadowed it.
    *   **Purpose:** Used for constants associated with the class, default values, or shared state across all instances (use shared state carefully).

*   **Static Methods (`@staticmethod`)**
    *   **Definition:** Defined within the class using the `@staticmethod` decorator. They **do not** receive `self` (or `cls`) as the first argument.
    *   **Ownership:** Belongs to the class.
    *   **Access:** Can be called through the class name (`ClassName.static_method()`) or an instance (`instance.static_method()`).
    *   **Purpose:** Used for utility functions that are logically related to the class but do not depend on the state of any specific instance *or* the class itself. They behave like regular <font color="#ffff00">functions namespaced within the class</font>.

*   **Class Methods (`@classmethod`)**
    *   **Definition:** Defined within the class using the `@classmethod` decorator. They receive the *class itself* (`cls`) as their first argument, not the instance (`self`).
    *   **Ownership:** Belongs to the class.
    *   **Access:** Can be called through the class name (`ClassName.class_method()`) or an instance (`instance.class_method()`). When called, the first argument (`cls`) is <font color="#ffff00">automatically passed the class</font>.
    *   **Purpose:** Often used as alternative constructors (factory methods) or to operate on class attributes (`cls.class_attribute`). They know about the class they belong to.

**Example:**

```python
class Car:
    # Class attribute: Shared by all Car instances
    num_wheels = 4
    num_cars_created = 0 # Shared counter

    def __init__(self, make, model):
        # Instance attributes
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        # Access and modify class attribute when a new instance is created
        Car.num_cars_created += 1

    # Instance method
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"This is a {self.make} {self.model} with {self.num_wheels} wheels.")
        # Note: Accessing num_wheels via self works because Python looks
        # for it on the instance first, then on the class if not found.

    @staticmethod
    def is_eco_friendly(fuel_type):
        # Doesn't need instance (self) or class (cls) information
        return fuel_type.lower() in ["electric", "hybrid"]

    @classmethod
    def get_total_cars(cls):
        # Operates on the class (cls), accessing a class attribute
        print(f"Total cars created: {cls.num_cars_created}")
        return cls.num_cars_created

    @classmethod
    def create_sports_car(cls, make):
        # Alternative constructor (factory method) using the class (cls)
        # It knows how to create an instance of its own class (or a subclass)
        return cls(make, "Sports Model")

# Access class attribute via the class
print(f"Cars usually have {Car.num_wheels} wheels.") # Output: Cars usually have 4 wheels.

# Create instances
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
car2 = Car("Tesla", "Model 3")

# Access class attribute via an instance (reads the shared value)
print(f"{car1.make} has {car1.num_wheels} wheels.") # Output: Toyota has 4 wheels.

# Call instance method
car1.display_info() # Output: This is a Toyota Camry with 4 wheels.

# Call static method (via class or instance)
print(f"Is electric eco-friendly? {Car.is_eco_friendly('Electric')}") # Output: True
print(f"Is gasoline eco-friendly? {car2.is_eco_friendly('Gasoline')}")# Output: False

# Call class method (via class or instance)
Car.get_total_cars() # Output: Total cars created: 2
car1.get_total_cars() # Output: Total cars created: 2 (still accesses the shared class state)

# Use class method as a factory
sports_car = Car.create_sports_car("Ferrari")
sports_car.display_info() # Output: This is a Ferrari Sports Model with 4 wheels.
Car.get_total_cars() # Output: Total cars created: 3
```

**Summary Table:**

| **Static Method** | Class            | None           | No                           | No                       | `@staticmethod` | Utility functions related to class, no state access needed |
| **Class Method**  | Class            | `cls`          | No                           | Yes                      | `@classmethod` | Factory methods (alt. constructors), operate on class state |

Understanding this distinction is key to writing well-structured object-oriented Python code. You choose the type of member based on whether the data or behavior relates to individual objects or the class as a whole.
