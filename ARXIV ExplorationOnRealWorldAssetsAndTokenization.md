### Limitation of Traditional Asset Mgmt

entry barriers, restricted liquidity, and indivisible ownership

it may take months or even years for the owner to find suitable buyers or tenants at the desired price.
It’s not feasible to split ownership of the asset, selling a portion while retaining some for themselves

### Applications

back in 2018, Elevated Returns (ER) in New York led the world’s first real estate tokenization project. The company utilized Ethereum blockchain technology to sell 18 million digital security tokens, representing ownership shares in the Aspen Ridge Resort [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.01111v1#bib.bib2).

Now there are many platforms like Artchain [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.01111v1#bib.bib3)]. Each masterpiece is marked with an ID, which can be denoted as a token in the smart contract.

Countries like *Georgia and Sweden* have implemented blockchain to manage land registry and asset ownership.[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.01111v1#bib.bib5)],[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.01111v1#bib.bib6)].
The technique can make it possible to store important data permanently and transfer it between different participants efficiently.

## Technical Foundation

Blockchain technology provides a decentralized digital ledger which records transactions across many computers. Thus, the registered transactions *can't be altered retroactively*. This technology lays a foundation for cryptocurrency systems and is valuable for the integrity and verifiability of data without a central authority.

### III-BConsensus Mechanisms

Consensus mechanisms are protocols that make sure all participants in a blockchain network agree on the current state of the ledger.
 include Proof of Work (PoW) which involves complex computations to secure transactions. While Proof of Stake (PoS) selects validators based on their token holdings.

### III-CSmart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code.

## IV Standards and Regulatory Considerations

### IV-ACurrent Standards for Tokenization
>Ethereum Request for Comment
#### IV-A1 ERC-20

a common set of rules that an Ethereum token has to implement. [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.01111v1#bib.bib8)].
developers can create new tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem.
provides a minimal set of functionalities for tracking and transferring tokens, including key methods like *transfer, approve, balanceof, allowance and transferFrom*.

Allowance Mechanism: This allows token holders to authorize other addresses to *spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf*. This provides a secure way to interact with smart contracts without transferring tokens directly.

#### IV-A2 ERC-721

ERC-721 defines a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which is used to implement a standard API within smart contracts for tracking and transferring NFTs[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.01111v1#bib.bib9)].

- Uniqueness. Each token is distinct. ERC 721 is *therefore* be applied for repring ownership of *assets* such as digital art.
- Metadata Extension. Can be retrieved with *certain codes*.
- Enumeration Extension. This is an optional function for all ERC-721 contract
