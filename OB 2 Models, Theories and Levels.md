### Basic OB Model

#### Core logic
An **abstraction** of reality *Or* A simplified representation of real world phenomena.
from known things and analyse the situation, what how where...
#### What
what should be considered as part of the explanation of the social or individual phenomena of interest
#### How 
how are they related it typically introduces causality
#### Why
most difficult
challenging the inderlying rationales supporting accepted theories, leading to reconceptualization of affected theories
theories are oftenchallenged, as their assuptions to be judged unrealistic
> Please learn more about this, through the paper 1989.

#### Who, Where, and When

these serve as contextual factors.
This might make the once helpful models work no more. We need to understand why those anomaly exists. Related *Who* *Where When* serve as perspectives for observing and analysing.
Then, we can revise the *How* and *What* of the model to *accommodate this new info*.
#### What and How

Simply modifying factors(Whats) is not sufficient. Existing relationships between the variables need changes too.

### Contextual 


### Conceptual Model

*[[Contextual Factor]]*: Example: Americans feels embarrassed when speaking randomly  in China.
Old model fails, *why*? This anomaly exists, then revise, *How & what* $\implies$ *theory developments*
![[Pasted image 20250301115053.png]]
*Guiding Questions*. There are four questions.
**Whetten 1989 On building theories** Find a interesting question. *Lovely and Useful*

```Guiding
1. What is new?
	Makes a significant, value-added contribution to current thinking
2. So what?
	Change the reserch practice
	Remedy alleged deficiencies in current theories
	Change the way organizational scholars think
3. Why so?
	Compelling underlying logic and supporting evidence
	Explicit assumptions
	Believable views
4.   Well done?
	Reflect seasoned thinking; 
	Convey completeness and thoroughness; 
	Cover multiple theoretical elements (What, How, Why, When-Where-Who).
5. Done well?
	Written well; 
	Flow logically; 
	Enjoyable to read; 
	Easily accessed central ideas; 
	Interesting; Format and content.
6. Why now?
	Timely; 
	Advance current discussions, Stimulate new discussions 
	– why is this an important contemporary issue
7. Who cares?
	Attracts a broad audience – is this a generally relevant issue
	
```


*A decriptive process of Old Models and New Settings*
If an old model fits a new setting, actually it should not. Then there should be investigation on whether there are Qualitative changes in the boundaries of theory, which leads to *Theory Development*.
e.g. *[[Psychological Safety]]*. , but from *AI Agents*.
### "How Much" Context

- Importance of context effects -- Need greater sensitivity
2 Reasons for a lack of context sensitivity:
	deliberate avoidance, and 
	careless oversight
2 Limitations of context insensitivity organization:
	- distorted understanding
	- forgo the opportunity to assess and improve the contextual sensitivity of the borrowed perspective
How to examine contextual effects?
	- rich description *Boss choose me, while I choose the tutor.*
	- direct observation and analysis of contextual effects *This need some investigation in person*(on one's own)
	- comparative studies *compare all the desired context, usually based on what we have experienced in person*

### Contribution *To* and *Of*  Theory

Please refer the PPT. The page with 2 boxes on both sides.

Also, please refer to all those tables within the papers given. The contents with in the tables, will serve as a important guidance in thinking out the problem along with its analysis and solution

>Context distinguishing effects is not related to X.
>Apply the theory in a context sensitive manner.

>•Context distinguishing effects is related to X.
>Test the organizational contextual range cross context test.
>Increase the theory value as a research tool.

>Context effects as explanantions for inconsistent cross-context result.
>Comparative research for context distinguishing effects

>The success of cross-context theorizing depends on an investigator’s ability to identify relevant context distinguishing differences.
>Identifying new context effects & enhance the utilitiy of a known context effects explanation.

*Suggestions*.
>Develop a Native Understanding of the Borrowed Theory.
>Manage the Perception of What Readers Consider Familiar and Unfamiliar.
>Use Graphical Models as Illustrations of Complex Theoretical Formulations.
>Participate in Cross-Context Research Teams.

### Levels of Analysis

*Please consider the 1985 paper for more detail*
From big bucket to smaller bucket.
*Studying OB from micro to macro LEVELS*. e.g Individual Group Organizational
*Social Psychology*. This plays a significant role in OB.

#### Individual Level.
```
Personality
Motivation
Perception
Stress Management
```
Organization consists of people.
*Question*. 
How to motivate people to perform? 
How do personal traits influence?
How do individuals perceive the same situation differently

*Scope of Study*.
Examines how individuals think, feel, and act within an organizational context.
Investigates factors such as personality, motivation, decision-making, and learning.

*Focals*. 
Intrapersonal process(*not interpersonal, this refers to individuals' changes during a period, due to the unstablity of a person's mind situation*), 
individual differences, 
behavioral outcomes.

>here you should notice that, so-called "exciting" conclusions may contribute to a more excellent HOMEWORK, *instead of* those vanilla viewpoints

>Related Subjects: Cognitive Psychology, Social Psychology, and Behavioral Psychology

*related subjects* -> Please lookup in the slides for more info
##### The definition of personality
Traits that influence *consistent patterns* of behavior (e.g., Big Five).
The Big Five Personality Traits (OCEAN):
- ·Openness: Creativity and curiosity.
- ·Conscientiousness: Organization and dependability.
- ·Extraversion: Sociability and energy.
- ·Agreeableness: Cooperation and kindness.
- ·Neuroticism: Emotional stability (low neuroticism = calm).
*Motivation*. 
	*Maslow's Hierarchy of metal ...* -> Please look up this in slides..
	*Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory*: Differentiates between hygiene factors (e.g., salary) and motivators (e.g., recognition).
	*Perceptions in OB*. how to interpret and make decisions? More concretely, BIAS and STEREOTYPING.
		*An example*. Once you have a perception, you tend to seek information to back your opinion.
		*An dicussion point*. What is the pros and cons, to hire merely students graduated from TOP unversities.
*Perception*.
how individuals interpret their environment to *make decisions*.

*Decision Making*.
Rational Decision-Making Model: Assumes logical evaluation of *all alternatives*.
Bounded Rationality: Decisions are *limited* by time, information availability, and cognitive capacity. We should consider all of these factors in future decision-making and other's decision-making.
##### Challenges
- research this alone
- example challenge
- discussion question
*Attention Theory*. Because of the distraction, people are less engaged.

#### Group Level

*Definition*. Group-level analysis examines how individuals interact within teams or groups, focusing on *group dynamics, processes, and outcomes*.

*Scope of Study*
How group *composition and structure* impact performance.
The role of *leadership and communication* in group functioning.
[[Group norms]], *cohesion, and [[group conflict]] resolution*.

>Conflict may lead to better outcome.

*Importance*. 
Most work is done with this, and groups serve as the *bridge*.
*Key Questions*. 
How do group dynamics influence *decison-making*. / 
How to make the team more effective?
How does diversity (in terms of skills, backgrounds, or perspectives) affect group performance? Can it sometimes hinder performance?
*An paradigm*. 
Using AI tools to select the topic in class assignments. 
Is this better or worse? 
If it is beneficial, how can my team implement this? 
How did this happened? 
How did the leader conceive this?
*Challenges*. 
	Balancing individual needs with group's objectives, 
	Understanding how informal norms influence formal processes within groups
	Measuring intangible factors like trust or cohesino
	*Decision Making*
		Risk of groupthink (*pressure* for conformity).
		Slower decision-making
