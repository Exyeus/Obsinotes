### Event and organization description

On December 5th, 2023, the celebrity of Oriental Selection(东方甄选), Dong Yuhui, read an essay in a livestream, and received wide appraise. However, later the official account topped a comment, that the essay was not by Dong completely, thus leading to hatre and discontent in Dong's enthusiastic fans. Then, the CEO Sun Dongxu responded them in a livestream, where his critical words and throwing phone to the floor, and the essay team provoked Dong a few times. These behaviors further irrigated the fans, who regarded his words as belittling Dong. Finally, Yu Minhong publicly apologized, and removed Sun from his position.
### The OB problem it is facing

Dong became famous and brought lots of profit to the company with his excellent personal traits. However, this also required the company to correctly handle its relationship between special individual, like Dong in this case, and the groups along with the whole organization, like the essay team(文案小组) involved in this event.

The interesting point of this problem, lies in that it's not about those traditional managements. With the application of the Internet and livestreams, one individual may gain unprecedented power from his fans, which is *a new phenomena*. It is also from here that this problem gains its significance. 
It is widely acknowledged that the *emergence of powerful AI tools* brings unlimited opportunity to an individual's productivity, hence there may be more "star employees" like Dong in the future, who can perform a lot, produce a lot and receive a lot. How to balance them and the organization is what we should consider as a new problem. More exactly, individuals resembling to Dong may have the ability to run an individual IP even company, then, what should the teams resembling to the essay team serve and present theirselves? From further learning, I got that Dong has left, establishing himself as a leader, and Oriental Selection has annouced its policy of not allowing star employees' emergence like Dong. And the later one also contribute to a problem worthy of thinking: *how to balance the uncomfortable weight from star employees, and the unexciting banality, from the perspective of organizational behavior?*
### The causes

Consider this further with the model. I think "*X*"(What causes) represents:
1. the charisma and capability of Dong that provides him numerous fans, attention and support, which can provide him with enormous finanial potential, and the weight of public opinion in his being challenged.
2. the imbalance between Dong and the essay team that the team publicly announced its work instead of dealing this rationally within the organization, which indicates the *malfunction of communication* in the organization, and the drawbacks in its system.
3. the former CEO Sun's behavior, that he irresponsibly imputed the result, perhaps from having not sufficiently communicating with the two parts also raise the crowd's discontent.
4. Dong became tired of this work, which had been a method to earn money and was now not a job consistent to his desired grace. This should be included in the scope of *personality* of *individual level*.

And "*Y*"(What results) represents:
1. the protest from irrational Dong's fans, 
2. the compelled position replacement, and 
3. the negative effect on the company's impression for the followers.

Also, the "*Z*"(Who, Where, When) represents some working patterns that are changing with the overall developments in society. Had not there been thrive livestream industry, Dong would not have accumulate such an external power that was able to compell the company to remove Sun's CEO position.

The level in which I analyse this problem are mainly in *individual* and *group*, for Dong and Sun represent *individual level*, and the communication between groups represents *group level*.

Another possible explanation, is that there was accumulated discontent among Dong, the team, and the CEO Sun. As for the root, maybe it was also generated from some organizational behavior factors, such as: 
1. the working environment did not provide the team member psychological comfortability, leading to their unstable mood which finally outbroke as the irrational comment handling;
2. the company had not stipulated the priciples of mission assignment between *individual* and *group*, and requirement of *external publicity*.

I think these are less fundamental. They emerged not only from negligence in managing organizational behavior, but also from, more essentially, the imbalance between Dong and the group as mentioned above.
