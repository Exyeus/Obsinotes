### Defining the character
This essay gives an analysis on **Tony Stark**, aka Iron Man in Marvel's superhero movie series. 
He had extraordinary abilities in technology, and at first inherited a huge military industry corporation from his father. But many great things transformed him from a wealthy arm baron who cared just himself and indulged in entertainment, to a hero committing to protecting the word. Eventually he died on duty of protecting the universe from elimination. And I will try to analyse his personality which he behaves in the movies *The Avengers 1*, *Iron Man 3* and *Captain America 2*. The three movies are published respectively in 2012, 2013 and 2014, therefore I think they are able to present Tony's personality in a relatively comprehensive degree. 

I will use the **Big Five** model to describe his personality trait.

*Openness to Experience*. High. Tony Stark had always been keen on innovation in different fields, including designing metal armor, AI and material science. He also represented the most open part of the team, as demonstrated by his designing AI system to amplify the protection, even severe result had happened.

*Conscientiousness*. High. He was keen on designing and producing metal armors powered by AI, **to provide stable protection for people**. Also, he took the responsibility to protect the civilians by publicly challenge the "terrorists" for the common people attacked by the "terrorists".  Also, he attached a lot of importance to, and acted proactively for his lover and friends when they were under threat.

*Extraversion*. High. He liked to show up in the public for the mean time. He also tended to express his opinion to his team members on his own initiative. He was also **quite assertive about his viewpoints**, even being questioned by most of those present. Also, he was energetic, and **seldom fell into a slump**.

*Agreeableness*. From low to medium. At first he was addicted to his work, thus paying little attention to what others did and what others thought. And even earlier, he **deliberately declined and made fun of** a scientist who admired him much. Also, he was **not warm** to others and **believe himself more than others**. After experiencing many events that offered him both dilemma and enlightment he became much more agreeable.

*Neuroticism*. From high to medium. At first, he **suffered from PTSD** caused by the near-death fights, for which he felt unsecured, and was not resilient to trauma-invoking things related to those fights. Later his further understanding to love and life, greatly relieved his problem.
### How personality affected his decision-making
#### Outcome of interest. 

1.	<u>At first, Tony spared no effort to develop armors, but finally he destroyed them after the victory</u>. 
His increased *agreeableness* made him aware of his lover's and friends' suffering from his arrogance, excessive focus on his own things and arbitrary behaviors. Also, his successful operation without armors had increase his confidence and somewhat reduced his *neuroticism*, therefore he realized that armor mattered less than people around him, and the essence of Iron Man was himself instead of those armors.

2.	<u>When residing in a boy's house and with his armor containing insufficient energy, the well-known Iron Man chose to make weapons to fight the enemies without armor.</u> 
I think his high degree of *openness* contributed to this unconventional behavior. Also, his *conscientiousness* offered him courage and motivation to do this.
#### Analysis on the pros and cons

His personality, as far as I am concerned, was relatively quite positive and beneficial. His *openness* brought him endless innovation, and the chance to improve his negative conventions. His *extraversion* and *conscientiousness*, which brought him lots of trouble and even death in the following movies, meanwhile made his life more wonderful and saved lots of people's lives. And his *agreeableness*, though not very high, actually made his reasonable opinions kept under others' doubt, and further led to lots of benefits enough to offset bad results from this trait. *neuroticism* brought trouble, but quite less than the benefits mentioned above, and he underwent most of the negative effects on his own.
#### Biased decisions from his personality

In Iron Man 3, Tony relied excessively on his armors. This decision is derived from his traumatic *neuroticism* and high *conscientiousness* (In following movies, he never kept so many armors at the same time, which might suggest that building so much was not necessary). Also, his high *openness* also contributed to his iterative development and accumulation. 

Also, due to his high *conscientiousness* and medium *agreeableness*, he credited some disasters caused by them in operations to the lack of management on the group of superheroes. He completely denied those who hold opposite views, which lead to an internal conflict within the Avengers.
### Situations causing opposite effect

Let me start with an example. In the movie Captain America 2, he firmly  held the proposition of applying restrictions and managements on the S.H.I.E.L.D., completely disagreeing with those who hold opposing views, leading to the great differences in view within the team, which led to a severe conflict, causing lots damage and loss. His **lack in agreeableness, skills in modifying relationships, and understanding of team cohesiveness**, together led to his unchangeable attitude. 
In all, when **developing technologies and directly protecting people from attack**, his personality mainly benefited. But in terms of **dealing interpersonal relationship problems that are subtle, full of intrigues**, his personality may cause troubles, and even be exploited by his enemies, as in Captain America 2, Duke Zemo exploited his personality by informing him that his father was murdered by Winter Soldier, to start a intense battle and achieve the ultimate breakup in the Avengers.
