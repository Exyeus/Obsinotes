**Slide 6: The Radical Shift at Zappos**

*   **Title:** 2015: Zappos Embraces Holacracy
*   **Content:**
    *   **Action:** Radical implementation of Holacracy.
    *   **Characteristics:** Extremely flat hierarchy, no traditional managers.
    *   **Employee Experience:** Assigned to multiple "circles" with varied responsibilities.

*   **Citation:** (Rothaermel, 2022, p. 392)

**Slide 7: The Problem Emerges**
ok
*   **Title:** Consequences of the Shift: What Happened?
*   **Content:**
    *   **Outcome 1:** Significant decline in employee morale.
    *   **Outcome 2 (Turnover):** 18% workforce exit (250+ employees) by 2016.

*   **Citation:** (Rothaermel, 2022, p. 392; Open Space World, 2015, p. 12)

**Slide 8: Analytical Framework: Why the Decline?**
ok
*   **Title:** Unpacking the Problem: Key Drivers
*   **Content:**
    *   We will analyze the decline in morale and engagement through three lenses:
        *   **Emotion:** Negative Affect
        *   **Attitude:** Job Satisfaction (Leadership factors)
        *   **Motivation:** Career Path & Advancement
*   **Image Suggestion:** A magnifying glass over the "Problem" slide elements, or three interconnected boxes labeled Emotion, Attitude, Motivation.
*   **Citation:** N/A (This slide frames the analysis based on the provided text)

**Slide 9: Analysis - Emotion (Negative Affect)**

*   **Title:** Driver 1: Emotion - Loss of Control & Stress
*   **Content:**
    *   **Link:** Negative affect → Low morale (Bogáthy et al., 2007).
    *   **Cause 1: Decreased Control/Belonging:**
        *   Shift forced by CEO (Hsieh, 2010).
        *   Employees lacked input → Reduced sense of control & belonging.
    *   **Cause 2: High Demand, Low Control/Support (JDCS Model):**
        *   *Demand:* Pressure from "People Point" metric (salary link).
        *   *Control:* Role unpredictability via Governance Meetings (Luenendonk, 2019).
        *   *Support:* Rigid rules suppressed OCB, eroded communication culture (Luenendonk, 2019; corporate-rebels.com 2016).
*   **Image Suggestion:** A split image: one side showing a stressed person, the other showing puppet strings (loss of control) or a rigid rulebook.
*   **Citation:** (Bogáthy et al., 2007; Hsieh, 2010; Luenendonk, 2019; corporate-rebels.com 2016) *[Place citations relevant to each point near it or consolidate at bottom]*

**Slide 10: Analysis - Attitude (Job Satisfaction)**
ok
*   **Title:** Driver 2: Attitude - Leadership & Fairness Issues
*   **Content:**
    *   **Link:** Job Satisfaction → Engagement → Morale (Bilal et al., 2023).
    *   **Focus:** Leadership's role.
    *   **Issue 1: Poor Supervisor Relationships (Organizational Inertia):**
        *   Some managers resisted Holacracy, clung to old power (Skorková et al., 2019).
        *   Undermined trust, created tension (Reingold, 2016).
    *   **Issue 2: Perceived Unfairness (Informal Power):**
        *   Technical experts retained influence despite formal structure (Hur et al., 2019).
        *   Newcomers felt excluded from key roles → Perception of favoritism based on tenure, not merit (Reingold, 2016).
*   **Image Suggestion:** A visual of a broken chain of command or scales tilted unfairly. A quote bubble highlighting the employee frustration from Reingold (2016).
*   **Citation:** (Bilal et al., 2023; Reingold, 2016; Skorková et al., 2019; Hur et al., 2019)

**Slide 11: Analysis - Motivation**
ok
*   **Title:** Driver 3: Motivation - Lack of Clear Advancement
*   **Content:**
    *   **Link:** Promotions → Motivation → Morale (Chikumbindi, 2017).
    *   **Problem:** Holacracy removed clear career paths.
    *   **Ambiguity:** Confusion over hiring, firing, promotion processes (Rothaermel, 2022).
    *   **"People Point" System:** Perceived as unstable and unequal, further undermining motivation.
*   **Image Suggestion:** A confusing maze or a road sign with question marks instead of destinations.
*   **Citation:** (Chikumbindi, 2017, p.51; Rothaermel, 2022, p. 392)

**Slide 12: Analysis Summary**
ok
*   **Title:** Why Morale Declined: A Recap
*   **Content:**
    *   **Emotion:** Forced change & high-stress environment led to negative affect.
    *   **Attitude:** Resistance from legacy leadership and perceived unfairness damaged job satisfaction.
    *   **Motivation:** Absence of clear career paths reduced motivation.
    *   **Result:** High turnover and low engagement among remaining employees.
*   **Image Suggestion:** A simple flowchart summarizing: Causes (Control, Fairness, Career Path) -> Intermediate Mechanisms (Negative Affect, Low Satisfaction, Low Motivation) -> Outcomes (Low Morale, Turnover).
*   **Citation:** (Consolidate key sources: Rothaermel, 2022; Hsieh, 2010; Reingold, 2016; Chikumbindi, 2017)

**(Part 3: Solutions - Looking Ahead)**
ok

    *   Let's explore potential strategies, starting with common pitfalls.
*   **Image Suggestion:** A crossroads sign, a question mark graphic.
*   **Citation:** N/A

**Slide 14: Unfeasible Solutions (Cautionary Notes)**
ok
*   **Title:** Paths to Avoid: Common Pitfalls
*   **Content:**
    *   **1. Total Negation:** Abruptly quitting the reform.
        *   *Risk:* Undermines credibility, ignores root causes (Recency Bias, Attribution Errors).
    *   **2. Blindfolded Advancing:** Pushing ahead ignoring dissent.
        *   *Risk:* Overlooks negative feedback, deepens divisions (Confirmation Bias, False Consensus Effect).
*   **Image Suggestion:** Icons for "Stop" or "Wrong Way" signs next to brief descriptions.
*   **Citation:** (Briefly cite definitions if needed, but focus is on the concepts from your text).

**Slide 15: Feasible Solution 1: See It Through**

*   **Title:** Option 1: See It Through - Commit & Refine
*   **Content:**
    *   **Approach:** Continue Holacracy, using severance to retain committed employees.
    *   **Anticipated Outcome:** Smaller, potentially more aligned and efficient workforce.
    *   **Implementation:** Needs gradual, step-by-step refinement.
    *   **Potential OB Benefits:**
        *   Increased Org. Identification ("Zapponians") & Cohesiveness.
        *   Psychological Empowerment (Meaningfulness, Self-determination).
        *   Affective Commitment (Emotional attachment).
        *   Improved Engagement & Job Involvement.
*   **Image Suggestion:** A visual of filtering/refining, a smaller but stronger core group, gears meshing smoothly.
*   **Citation:** (Relate points back to general OB principles supported by your analysis).

**Slide 16: Feasible Solution 2: Keep It Small**
ok
*   **Title:** Option 2: Keep It Small - Integrate Selectively
*   **Content:**
    *   **Approach:** Return largely to hierarchy, but integrate Holacracy elements where beneficial (e.g., task forces, innovation groups).
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses confusion, retains management structure, leverages scale.
    *   **Focus:** Develop leaders adept at choosing the right structure for the task.
    *   **Potential OB Benefits:**
        *   Reduced Destructive Turnover (Transforms EXIT to VOICE/LOYALTY - EVLN implied).
        *   Improved Organizational Stability.
        *   Reduced Role Ambiguity/Conflict (Psychological comfort of hierarchy).
        *   Leverages hierarchy for scale/routine tasks.
*   **Image Suggestion:** A hybrid model graphic (part hierarchy, part network), building blocks being selectively added.
*   **Citation:** (Relate points back to general OB principles like EVLN, role theory, stability).

**Slide 17: Summary & Key Takeaways**

*   **Title:** Lessons from the Zappos Holacracy Experiment
*   **Content:**
    *   Zappos' bold Holacracy shift led to significant morale, engagement, and turnover issues.
    *   Key drivers included loss of control, perceived unfairness, leadership resistance, and lack of career paths.
    *   Radical organizational change is complex and requires careful management of emotional, attitudinal, and motivational factors.
    *   Potential paths involve either full commitment with refinement or a hybrid approach blending hierarchy and Holacracy.
    *   The "right" structure depends on context, culture, and goals.

**Speaker Guidance Notes (Implicit in Structure):**

*   **Intro (Slides 3-5):** Set the stage – establish Zappos' strong pre-Holacracy identity and explain the novel Holacracy concept simply.
*   **Problem (Slides 6-7):** Clearly state the change and its negative, documented consequences.
*   **Analysis (Slides 8-12):** This is the core. Speakers should elaborate on *each* driver (Emotion, Attitude, Motivation), explaining the OB concepts (JDCS, Org Inertia, etc.) and linking them directly to the Zappos evidence cited on the slides. Use the X -> Y logic explicitly in the explanation (e.g., "The lack of control, *X*, led to negative affect, *Y*, contributing to low morale").
*   **Solutions (Slides 13-16):** Explain *why* the unfeasible solutions are flawed using the mentioned biases. Clearly present the two feasible options, explaining the *logic* behind each and connecting the "Potential OB Benefits" back to the problems identified in the analysis (e.g., "Seeing it Through addresses the commitment issue identified earlier").
*   **Conclusion (Slide 17):** Briefly reiterate the main narrative and the core tensions/lessons learned.

This structure provides a clear visual guide, adheres to the requirements, and allows the speakers to delve into the analysis and implications effectively. Remember to keep slide text minimal and use visuals to enhance understanding.
